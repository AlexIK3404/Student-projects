       "'\\n  \\n  \\n   To Jill Prewett and Aine Kiely,\\n   The godmothers of Swing\\n  \\n  \\n   \\n    1. OWL POST\\n   \\n   Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.\\n   It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large leather bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, \"Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless Discuss.\"\\n   The quill paused at the top of a likely looking paragraph. Harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the book, and read:\\n   \\n    Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in various disguises.\\n   \\n   Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he\\'d probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer.\\n   The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley, were Harry\\'s only living relatives. They were Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry\\'s dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys\\' roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to lock away Harry\\'s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors.\\n   This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work. One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry\\'s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon\\'s new company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street would notice it too), Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn\\'t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night.\\n   Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, all because he\\'d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation.\\n   Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry\\'s best friends at Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn\\'t, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily, it had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.\\n   \"Vernon Dursley speaking.\"\\n   Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard Ron\\'s voice answer.\\n   \"HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I-WANT-TO-TALK-TO-HARRY-POTTER!\"\\n   Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm.\\n   \"WHO IS THIS?\" he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. \"WHO ARE YOU?\"\\n   \"RON-WEASLEY!\" Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field. \"I\\'M-A-FRIEND-OF-HARRY\\'S-FROM-SCHOOL-\"\\n   Uncle Vernon\\'s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to the spot.\\n   \"THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!\" he roared, now holding the receiver at arm\\'s length, as though frightened it might explode. \"I DON\\'T KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOURE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON\\'T YOU COME NEAR MY FAMILY!\"\\n   And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider.\\n   The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.\\n   \"HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE-PEOPLE LIKE YOU!\" Uncle Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.\\n   Ron obviously realized that he\\'d gotten Harry into trouble, because he hadn\\'t called again. Harry\\'s other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn\\'t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry\\'s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts.\\n   So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one. There was just one very small improvement-after swearing that he wouldn\\'t use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had been allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time.\\n   Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late, Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he\\'d finish this essay tomorrow night...\\n   He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, quill, and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.\\n   It was one o\\'clock in the morning. Harry\\'s stomach gave a funny jolt. He had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour.\\n   Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in his life. The Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one.\\n   Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig\\'s large, empty cage, to the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent for two nights now. Harry wasn\\'t worried about her: she\\'d been gone this long before. But he hoped she\\'d be back soon-she was the only living creature in this house who didn\\'t flinch at the sight of him.\\n   Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few inches over the last year. His jet black hair, however, was just as it always had been-stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.\\n   Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry\\'s parents, because Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had been murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort\\'s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort had fled...\\n   But Harry had come face to face with him at Hogwarts. Remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday.\\n   He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harry realized what he was seeing.\\n   Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment, was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry\\'s direction. He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For a split second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wondering whether to slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was, leapt aside.\\n   Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third, which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on Harry\\'s bed, and the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.\\n   Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once-his name was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords around Errol\\'s legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol to Hedwig\\'s cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to gulp some water.\\n   Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join Errol.\\n   Harry didn\\'t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package, it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off through the window into the night.\\n   Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol\\'s package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his first ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out-a letter and a newspaper clipping.\\n   The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the Daily Prophet, because the people in the black and white picture were moving. Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:\\n   \\n    MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE\\n    Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.\\n    A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, \"We will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.\"\\n    The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children currently attend.\\n   \\n   Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tall, balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though the black and white picture didn\\'t show it) with flaming red hair. Right in the middle of the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny.\\n   Harry couldn\\'t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor. He picked up Ron\\'s letter and unfolded it.\\n   \\n    Dear Harry,\\n    Happy birthday!\\n    Look, I\\'m really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the Muggles didn\\'t give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he reckons I shouldn\\'t have shouted.\\n    It\\'s amazing here in Egypt. Bill\\'s taken us around all the tombs and you wouldn\\'t believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum wouldn\\'t let Ginny come in the last one. There were all these mutant skeletons in there, of Muggles who\\'d broken in and grown extra heads and stuff.\\n    I couldn\\'t believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw. Seven hundred galleons! Most of it\\'s gone on this trip, but they\\'re going to buy me a new wand for next year.\\n   \\n   Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron\\'s old wand had snapped. It had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to Hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds.\\n   \\n    We\\'ll be back about a week before term starts and we\\'ll be going up to London to get my wand and our new books. Any chance of meeting you there?\\n    Don\\'t let the Muggles get you down!\\n    Try and come to London,\\n    Ron\\n    P.S. Percy\\'s Head Boy. He got the letter last week.\\n   \\n   Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. He had pinned his Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, his horn rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun.\\n   Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top. There was another note from Ron beneath it.\\n   \\n    Harry-this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there\\'s someone untrustworthy around, it\\'s supposed to light up and spin. Bill says it\\'s rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn\\'t reliable, because it kept lighting up at dinner last night. But he didn\\'t realize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup.\\n    Bye-Ron\\n   \\n   Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of his clock. He looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the parcel Hedwig had brought.\\n   Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter, this time from Hermione.\\n   \\n    Dear Harry,\\n    Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I do hope you\\'re all right.\\n    I\\'m on holiday in France at the moment and I didn\\'t know how I was going to send this to you-what if they\\'d opened it at customs?-but then Hedwig turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl order; there was an advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I\\'ve been getting it delivered; it\\'s so good to keep up with what\\'s going on in the wizarding world). Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a week ago? I bet he\\'s learning loads. I\\'m really jealous-the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating.\\n    There\\'s some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too. I\\'ve rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things I\\'ve found out, I hope it\\'s not too long-it\\'s two rolls of parchment more than Professor Binns asked for.\\n    Ron says he\\'s going to be in London in the last week of the holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hope you can. If not, I\\'ll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September first!\\n    Love from Hermione\\n    P.S. Ron says Percy\\'s Head Boy. I\\'ll bet Percy\\'s really pleased. Ron doesn\\'t seem too happy about it.\\n   \\n   Harry laughed as he put Herrmone\\'s letter aside and picked up her present. It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells-but it wasn\\'t. His heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading Broomstick Servicing Kit.\\n   \"Wow, Hermione!\" Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.\\n   There was a large jar of Fleetwood\\'s High Finish Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tall Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.\\n   Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world-highly dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry\\'s most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.\\n   Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was from Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped loudly-as though it had jaws.\\n   Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn\\'t have a normal person\\'s view of what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy vicious, three headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin.\\n   Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled.\\n   And out fell-a book. Harry just had time to register its handsome green cover, emblazoned with the golden title The Monster Book of Monsters, before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab.\\n   \"Uh oh,\" Harry muttered.\\n   The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room. Harry followed it stealthily. The book was hiding in the dark space under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it.\\n   \"Ouch!\"\\n   The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, still scuttling on its covers. Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward, and managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the room next door.\\n   Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw it down on the bed and reached for Hagrid\\'s card.\\n   \\n    Dear Harry,\\n    Happy Birthday!\\n    Think you might find this useful for next year. Won\\'t say no more here. Tell you when I see you.\\n    Hope the Muggles are treating you right.\\n    All the best,\\n    Hagrid\\n   \\n   It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful, but he put Hagrid\\'s card up next to Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s, grinning more broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from Hogwarts left.\\n   Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the envelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read:\\n   \\n    Dear Mr. Potter,\\n    Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first. The Hogwarts Express will leave ftom King\\'s Cross station, platform nine and three-quarters, at eleven o\\'clock.\\n    Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign.\\n    A list of books for next year is enclosed.\\n    Yours sincerely,\\n    Professor M. McGonagall\\n    Deputy Headmistress\\n   \\n   Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot there. But how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form?\\n   He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o\\'clock in the morning.\\n   Deciding that he\\'d worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up, Harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart he\\'d made for himself, counting down the days left until his return to Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing his three birthday cards.\\n   Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just like everyone else-glad, for the first time in his life, that it was his birthday.\\n  \\n  \\n   \\n    2. AUNT MARGE\\'S BIG MISTAKE\\n   \\n   Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand new television, a welcome home for the summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually.\\n   Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict:\\n   \"...The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be reported immediately.\"\\n   \"No need to tell us he\\'s no good,\" snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. \"Look at the state of him, the filthy layabout! Look at his hair!\"\\n   He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted, elbow length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.\\n   The reporter had reappeared.\\n   \"The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today-\"\\n   \"Hang on!\" barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. \"You didn\\'t tell us where that maniac\\'s escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!\"\\n   Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse faced, whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number. She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring, law abiding neighbors.\\n   \"When will they learn,\" said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his large purple fist, \"that hanging\\'s the only way to deal with these people?\"\\n   \"Very true,\" said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door\\'s runner beans.\\n   Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, \"I\\'d better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge\\'s train gets in at ten.\"\\n   Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.\\n   \"Aunt Marge?\" he blurted out. \"Sh-she\\'s not coming here, is she?\"\\n   Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon\\'s sister. Even though she was not a blood relative of Harry\\'s (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia\\'s sister), he had been forced to call her \"Aunt\" all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She didn\\'t often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn\\'t bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry\\'s mind.\\n   At Dudley\\'s fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley\\'s eyes.\\n   \"Marge\\'ll be here for a week,\" Uncle Vernon snarled, \"and while we\\'re on the subject\"-he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry-\"we need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her.\"\\n   Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley\\'s favorite form of entertainment.\\n   \"Firstly,\" growled Uncle Vernon, \"you\\'ll keep a civil tongue in your head when you\\'re talking to Marge.\"\\n   \"All right,\" said Harry bitterly, \"if she does when she\\'s talking to me.\"\\n   \"Secondly,\" said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry\\'s reply, \"as Marge doesn\\'t know anything about your abnormality, I don\\'t want any-any funny stuff while she\\'s here. You behave yourself, got me?\"\\n   \"I will if she does,\" said Harry through gritted teeth.\\n   \"And thirdly,\" said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face, \"we\\'ve told Marge you attend St. Brutus\\'s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.\"\\n   \"What?\" Harry yelled.\\n   \"And you\\'ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there\\'ll be trouble,\" spat Uncle Vernon.\\n   Harry sat there, white faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a weeklong visit-it was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him, including that pair of Uncle Vernon\\'s old socks.\\n   \"Well, Petunia,\" said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, \"I\\'ll be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?\"\\n   \"No,\" said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry.\\n   \"Duddy\\'s got to make himself smart for his auntie,\" said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley\\'s thick blond hair. \"Mummy\\'s bought him a lovely new bow tie.\"\\n   Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder. \"See you in a bit, then,\" he said, and he left the kitchen.\\n   Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to the front door.\\n   Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.\\n   \"I\\'m not taking you,\" he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him.\\n   \"Like I wanted to come,\" said Harry coldly. \"I want to ask you something.\"\\n   Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.\\n   \"Third years at Hog-at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes,\" said Harry.\\n   \"So?\" snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the door.\\n   \"I need you to sign the permission form,\" said Harry in a rush.\\n   \"And why should I do that?\" sneered Uncle Vernon.\\n   \"Well,\" said Harry, choosing his words carefully, \"it\\'ll be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits-\"\\n   \"St. Brutus\\'s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!\" bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon\\'s voice.\\n   \"Exactly,\" said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon\\'s large, purple face. \"It\\'s a lot to remember. I\\'ll have to make it sound convincing, won\\'t I? What if I accidentally let something slip?\"\\n   \"You\\'ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won\\'t you?\" roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood his ground.\\n   \"Knocking the stuffing out of me won\\'t make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her,\" he said grimly.\\n   Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce.\\n   \"But if you sign my permission form,\" Harry went on quickly, \"I swear I\\'ll remember where I\\'m supposed to go to school, and I\\'ll act like a Mug-like I\\'m normal and everything.\"\\n   Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.\\n   \"Right,\" he snapped finally. \"I shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge\\'s visit. If, at the end of it, you\\'ve toed the line and kept to the story, I\\'ll sign your ruddy form.\"\\n   He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.\\n   Harry didn\\'t return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he\\'d better start now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he went to Hedwig\\'s cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake.\\n   \"Hedwig,\" he said gloomily, \"you\\'re going to have to clear off for a week. Go with Errol. Ron\\'ll look after you. I\\'ll write him a note, explaining. And don\\'t look at me like that\"-Hedwig\\'s large amber eyes were reproachful-\"it\\'s not my fault. It\\'s the only way I\\'ll be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.\"\\n   Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe.\\n   But Harry didn\\'t have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest.\\n   \"Do something about your hair!\" Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the hall.\\n   Harry couldn\\'t see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Aunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the happier she would be.\\n   All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon\\'s car pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path.\\n   \"Get the door!\" Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.\\n   A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.\\n   On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purplefaced, she even had a mustache, though not as bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked under the other was an old and evil tempered bulldog.\\n   \"Where\\'s my Dudders?\" roared Aunt Marge. \"Where\\'s my neffy poo?\"\\n   Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase into Harry\\'s stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seized Dudley in a tight one armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek.\\n   Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge\\'s hugs because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty pound note clutched in his fat fist.\\n   \"Petunia!\" shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia\\'s bony cheekbone.\\n   Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door.\\n   \"Tea, Marge?\" he said. \"And what will Ripper take?\"\\n   \"Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,\" said Aunt Marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with the suitcase. But Harry wasn\\'t complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long as he could.\\n   By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.\\n   \"Who\\'s looking after the other dogs, Marge?\" Uncle Vernon asked.\\n   \"Oh, I\\'ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,\" boomed Aunt Marge. \"He\\'s retired now, good for him to have something to do. But I couldn\\'t leave poor old Ripper. He pines if he\\'s away from me.\"\\n   Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt Marge\\'s attention to Harry for the first time.\\n   \"So!\" she barked. \"Still here, are you?\"\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Don\\'t you say \\'yes\\' in that ungrateful tone,\" Aunt Marge growled. \"It\\'s damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn\\'t have done it myself. You\\'d have gone straight to an orphanage if you\\'d been dumped on my doorstep.\"\\n   Harry was bursting to say that he\\'d rather live in an orphanage than with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him. He forced his face into a painful smile.\\n   \"Don\\'t you smirk at me!\" boomed Aunt Marge. \"I can see you haven\\'t improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners into you.\" She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and said, \"Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?\"\\n   \"St. Brutus\\'s,\" said Uncle Vernon promptly. \"It\\'s a first rate institution for hopeless cases.\"\\n   \"I see,\" said Aunt Marge. \"Do they use the cane at St. Brutus\\'s, boy?\" she barked across the table.\\n   \"Er-\" Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge\\'s back.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly, he added, \"All the time.\"\\n   \"Excellent,\" said Aunt Marge. \"I won\\'t have this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A good thrashing is what\\'s needed in ninety nine cases out of a hundred. Have you been beaten often?\"\\n   \"Oh, yeah,\" said Harry, \"loads of times.\"\\n   Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes.\\n   \"I still don\\'t like your tone, boy,\" she said. \"If you can speak of your beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren\\'t hitting you hard enough. Petunia, I\\'d write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boy\\'s case.\"\\n   Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain; in any case, he changed the subject abruptly.\\n   \"Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner, eh?\"\\n   As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt Marge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times, so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement. She delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn\\'t got a present too. She also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry such an unsatisfactory person.\\n   \"You mustn\\'t blame yourself for the way the boy\\'s turned out, Vernon,\" she said over lunch on the third day. \"If there\\'s something rotten on the inside, there\\'s nothing anyone can do about it.\"\\n   Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form, he told himself: Think about Hogsmeade. Don\\'t say anything. Don\\'t rise-\\n   Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine.\\n   \"It\\'s one of the basic rules of breeding,\" she said. \"You see it all the time with dogs. If there\\'s something wrong with the bitch, there\\'ll be something wrong with the pup-\"\\n   At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.\\n   \"Marge!\" squealed Aunt Petunia. \"Marge, are you all right?\"\\n   \"Not to worry,\" grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face with her napkin. \"Must have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster\\'s the other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip...\"\\n   But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry suspiciously, so he decided he\\'d better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could.\\n   Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply It had been a long time since he\\'d lost control and made something explode. He couldn\\'t afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn\\'t the only thing at stake-if he carried on like that, he\\'d be in trouble with the Ministry of Magic.\\n   Harry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school. His record wasn\\'t exactly clean either. Only last summer he\\'d gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive, Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts.\\n   He heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way.\\n   Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on him. This worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal.\\n   At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge\\'s stay arrived. Aunt Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles of wine. They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of Harry\\'s faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill making company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy.\\n   \"Can I tempt you, Marge?\"\\n   Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face was very red.\\n   \"Just a small one, then,\" she chuckled. \"A bit more than that... and a bit more... that\\'s the ticket.\"\\n   Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon\\'s angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out.\\n   \"Aah,\" said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down. \"Excellent nosh, Petunia. It\\'s normally just a fry up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after...\" She burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach. \"Pardon me. But I do like to see a healthy sized boy,\" she went on, winking at Dudley. \"You\\'ll be a proper sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I\\'ll have a spot more brandy, Vernon...\"\\n   \"Now, this one here-\"\\n   She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The Handbook, he thought quickly.\\n   \"This one\\'s got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was. Weak. Underbred.\"\\n   Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers.\\n   \"It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other day. Bad blood will out. Now, I\\'m saying nothing against your family, Petunia-\" she patted Aunt Petunia\\'s bony hand with her shovellike one \"-but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then she ran off with a wastrel and here\\'s the result right in front of us.\"\\n   Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp your broom firmly by the tail, he thought. But he couldn\\'t remember what came next. Aunt Marge\\'s voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle Vernon\\'s drills.\\n   \"This Potter,\" said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, \"you never told me what he did?\"\\n   Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents.\\n   \"He-didn\\'t work,\" said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry. \"Unemployed.\"\\n   \"As I expected!\" said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. \"A no account, good for nothing, lazy scrounger who-\"\\n   \"He was not,\" said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life.\\n   \"MORE BRANDY!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge\\'s glass. \"You, boy,\" he snarled at Harry. \"Go to bed, go on-\"\\n   \"No, Vernon,\" hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry\\'s. \"Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect)-\"\\n   \"They didn\\'t die in a car crash!\" said Harry, who found himself on his feet.\\n   \"They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!\" screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury. \"You are an insolent, ungrateful little-\"\\n   But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger-but the swelling didn\\'t stop. Her great red face started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech-next second, several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls-she was inflating like a monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a salami-\\n   \"MARGE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge\\'s whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly.\\n   \"NOOOOOOO!\"\\n   Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge\\'s feet and tried to pull her down again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later, Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon\\'s leg.\\n   Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig\\'s empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.\\n   \"COME BACK IN HERE!\" he bellowed. \"COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!\"\\n   But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open, pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.\\n   \"She deserved it,\" Harry said, breathing very fast. \"She deserved what she got. You keep away from me.\" He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.\\n   \"I\\'m going,\" Harry said. \"I\\'ve had enough.\"\\n   And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig\\'s cage under his arm.\\n  \\n  \\n   \\n    3. THE KNIGHT BUS\\n   \\n   Harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic thumping of his heart.\\n   But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse fix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done serious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives weren\\'t swooping down on him where he sat.\\n   Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent.\\n   What was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and Hermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was sure that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them.\\n   He didn\\'t have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. He\\'d never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London. Unless...\\n   He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his heart was now thumping painfully fast), a bit more magic couldn\\'t hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father-what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to London? Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and... begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn\\'t sit on this wall forever, or he\\'d find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.\\n   Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak-but before he had found it, he straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more.\\n   A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses.\\n   He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he\\'d know whether it was just a stray cat or-something else.\\n   \"Lumos,\" Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.\\n   Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter-\\n   There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light-\\n   With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus.\\n   For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night.\\n   \"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve-\"\\n   The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of Harry, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples.\\n   \"What were you doin\\' down there?\" said Stan, dropping his professional manner.\\n   \"Fell over,\" said Harry.\\n   \"\\'Choo fall over for?\" sniggered Stan.\\n   \"I didn\\'t do it on purpose,\" said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence. The Knight Bus\\'s headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was empty.\\n   \"\\'Choo lookin\\' at?\" said Stan.\\n   \"There was a big black thing,\" said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the gap. \"Like a dog... but massive...\"\\n   He looked a round at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan\\'s eyes move to the scar on Harry\\'s forehead.\\n   \"Woss that on your \\'ead?\" said Stan abruptly.\\n   \"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If the Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didn\\'t want to make it too easy for them.\\n   \"Woss your name?\" Stan persisted.\\n   \"Neville Longbottom,\" said Harry, saying the first name that came into his head. \"So-so this bus,\" he went on quickly, hoping to distract Stan, \"did you say it goes anywhere?\"\\n   \"Yep,\" said Stan proudly, \"anywhere you like, long\\'s it\\'s on land. Can\\'t do nuffink underwater.\\n   \"\\'Ere,\" he said, looking suspicious again, \"you did flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand \\'and, dincha?\"\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry quickly. \"Listen, how much would it be to get to London?\"\\n   \"Eleven Sickles,\" said Stan, \"but for fifteen you get \\'ot chocolate, and for fifteen you get an \\'ot water bottle an\\' a toofbrush in the color of your choice.\"\\n   Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, and shoved some gold into Stan\\'s hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with Hedwig\\'s cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus.\\n   There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed, illuminating the wood paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, \"Not now, thanks, I\\'m pickling some slugs,\" and rolled over in his sleep.\\n \\n  \\n   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\n   \\n    THIS STATE OF THE ART RACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM LINED, SUPERFINE HANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND HARD POLISH AND HANDNUMBERED WITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED BIRCH TWIG IN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC PERFECTION, GIVING THE FIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION. THE FIREBOLT HAS AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND INCORPORATES AN UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.\\n    \"We are doing all we can to recapture Black,\" said the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, \"and we beg the magical community to remain calm.\"\\n    Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.\\n    \"Well, really, I had to, don\\'t you know,\" said an irritable Fudge. \"Black is mad. He\\'s a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the Prime Minister\\'s assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black\\'s true identity to anyone. And-let\\'s face it-who\\'d believe him if he did?\"\\n   \"\\'Bye, Neville!\" called Stan.\\n   Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom\\'s lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.\\n   \"So all that remains,\" said Fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, \"is to decide where you\\'re going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and-\"\\n   \"Hang on,\" said Harry quickly, \"I\\'ve already got one of those.\"\\n   \"He didn\\'t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?\" said Hermione.\\n   \"Anything else?\" he said.\\n   \"You \\'ave this one,\" Stan whispered, shoving Harry\\'s trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel. \"This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This is Neville Longbottom, Ern.\"\\n   Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed.\\n   \"Talk about summat else, Stan, there\\'s a good lad. Them Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.\"\\n   Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn\\'t help imagining what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights\\' time.\\n   \"\\'Ere you go, Madam Marsh,\" said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the way.\\n   Harry wouldn\\'t have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didn\\'t keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet.\\n   Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He looked strangely familiar.\\n   \"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron\\'s hand. \"And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what\\'s the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he\\'d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.\"\\n   \"Would we get a reward if we caught him?\" asked Ron. \"It\\'d be good to get some more money-\"\\n   \"Don\\'t want to lose you again, do we?\" said Fudge with a hearty laugh. \"No, no... best we know where you are... I mean...\"\\n   Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.\\n   \"Well, I\\'m taking more new subjects than you, aren\\'t I?\" said Hermione. \"Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies-\"\\n   \"What didja call Neville, Minister?\" he said excitedly.\\n   Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted.\\n   \"No, I don\\'t think so,\" said Hermione composedly. \"I really want an owl. I mean, Harry\\'s got Hedwig and you\\'ve got Errol-\"\\n   \"I hope you\\'re well?\" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced to the mayor.\\n   \"We tried to shut him in a pyramid,\" he told Harry. \"But Mum spotted us.\"\\n   Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.\\n   \"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\" he said, \"and I don\\'t ever want to go back to Privet Drive.\"\\n   \"Of course I don\\'t,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Well, Harry,\" said Fudge, pouring out tea, \"you\\'ve had us all in a right flap, I don\\'t mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle\\'s house like that! I\\'d started to think... but you\\'re safe, and that\\'s what matters.\"\\n   Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.\\n   \"Er-\" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers. The witch\\'s eyes moved from Scabbers\\'s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.\\n   \"He\\'s gorgeous, isn\\'t he?\" said Hermione, glowing.\\n   That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat\\'s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in Hermione\\'s arms.\\n   \"Hm,\" said the witch, picking up Scabbers. \"How old is this rat?\"\\n   \"Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then... You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that\\'s that, and no harm done.\"\\n   Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn\\'t believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn\\'t think of anything to say, and closed it again.\\n   \"Ah,\" he said. \"No, no, I\\'m very sorry, Harry, but as I\\'m not your parent or guardian-\"\\n   \"Bye,\" Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar.\\n   \"\\'Ear about that \\'Arry Potter? Blew up \\'is aunt! We \\'ad \\'im \\'ere on the Knight Bus, di\\'n\\'t we, Ern? \\'E was tryin\\' to run for it...\"\\n   He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn\\'t know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he\\'d ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last year. Harry wouldn\\'t soon forget the look of terror on Hagrid\\'s face when he had been told where he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.\\n   The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry\\'s pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.\\n   Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.\\n   \"Righto,\" said Stan. \"\\'Old tight, then.\"\\n   BANG.\\n   They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus\\'s way. The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the moment it opened, then set off-where, he didn\\'t know.\\n   Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabbylooking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.\\n   \"That man!\" Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. \"He was on the Muggle news!\"\\n   Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.\\n   \"Sit down, Harry,\" said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.\\n   Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle green suit and sat down opposite Harry.\\n   \"I broke the law!\" Harry said. \"The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!\"\\n   \"Okay,\" said Harry slowly, \"but why?\"\\n   \"Dunno,\" said Ron. \"Quite old. He used to belong to my brother.\"\\n   \"What was that?\"\\n   \"It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing-\"\\n   \"I haven\\'t,\" said Ron. \"Errol\\'s a family owl. All I\\'ve got is Scabbers.\" He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. \"And I want to get him checked over,\" he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. \"I don\\'t think Egypt agreed with him.\"\\n   Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to his whiskers.\\n   \"They \\'ad a job coverin\\' it up, din\\' they, Ern?\" Stan said. \"\\'Ole street blown up an\\' all them Muggles dead. What was it they said ad \\'appened, Ern?\"\\n   \"Get out of the way,\" said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry aside. He drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large, knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the Monster Books\\' cage.\\n   \"Harry! HARRY!\"\\n   They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue\\'s Ice Cream Parlor-Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him.\\n   \"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with their shopping.\\n   Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him.\\n   \"This is where we was before you flagged us down,\" he said. \"Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?\"\\n   \"Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?\" asked Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.\\n   \"If he weren\\'t when he went to Azkaban, he will be now,\" said Ern in his slow voice. \"I\\'d blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves him right, mind you... after what he did...\"\\n   \"They still haven\\'t caught him, then?\" he asked.\\n   \"Now, now, I\\'m sure you\\'ll feel differently once you\\'ve calmed down,\" said Fudge in a worried tone. \"They are your family, after all, and I\\'m sure you are fond of each other-er-very deep down.\"\\n   It didn\\'t occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now.\\n   \"So am I,\" admitted Harry. \"Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be arrested.\" He looked at Ron. \"Your dad doesn\\'t know why Fudge let me off, does he?\"\\n   \"Probably getting her owl.\"\\n   They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie. As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn\\'t carrying an owl. Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.\\n   \"You bought that monster?\" said Ron, his mouth hanging open.\\n   \"Hedwig!\" Harry gasped.\\n   The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry\\'s arm.\\n   \"Very well, thanks-\"\\n   \"Have you had any luck with Black yet?\" Harry asked.\\n   Fudge\\'s finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak.\\n   \"What\\'s up?\" said Harry.\\n   \"NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!\" cried the witch, but Scabbers, shot from between her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay legged on the floor, and then scampered for the door.\\n   \"Scary lookin\\' fing, inee?\" said Stan, who had been watching Harry read.\\n   \"He was like that when Percy gave him to me,\" said Ron defensively.\\n   \"An\\' now \\'e\\'s out,\" said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of Black\\'s gaunt face again. \"Never been a breakout from Azkaban before, \\'as there, Ern? Beats me \\'ow \\'e did it. Frightenin\\', eh? Mind, I don\\'t fancy \\'is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?\" Ernie suddenly shivered.\\n   \"Thanks,\" Harry said to Ern.\\n   He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig\\'s cage onto the pavement.\\n   \"What are you doing Muggle Studies for?\" said Ron, rolling his eyes at Harry. \"You\\'re Muggleborn! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already know all about Muggles!\"\\n   \"But you\\'re the Minister of Magic,\" said Harry eagerly. \"If you gave me permission-\"\\n   \"No,\" said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. \"They\\'ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far.\"\\n   \"Yeah,\" said Stan, still rubbing his chest. \"Yeah, that\\'s right. Very close to You-Know-\\'Oo, they say. Anyway, when little \\'Arry Potter got the better of You-Know-\\'Oo-\"\\n   Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again.\\n   \"-for Humongous Bighead,\" said Fred.\\n   Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding.\\n   \"Why?\" said Percy curiously.\\n   \"It\\'s been a very weird night, Hedwig,\" he yawned.\\n   And without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep.\\n  \\n   \\n    Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis.\\n    4. THE LEAKY CAULDRON\\n   \\n   Price on request... Harry didn\\'t like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life-but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn\\'t ask for the price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt.\\n   There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin\\'s Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Most important of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include those for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and Divination.\\n   Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of the usual display of goldembossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.\\n   Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the required book for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.\\n   As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward him.\\n   \"How about a nice book?\" said Ron innocently.\\n   \"No, I\\'m sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,\" said Fudge flatly. \"Perhaps you\\'ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think it\\'s best if you don\\'t... yes... well, I\\'ll be off. Enjoy your stay, Harry.\"\\n   And with a last smile and shake of Harry\\'s hand, Fudge left the room. Tom now moved forward, beaming at Harry.\\n   \"Irish International Side\\'s just put in an order for seven of these beauties!\" the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. \"And they\\'re favorites for the World Cup!\"\\n   A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign next to the broom:\\n   \\n   Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.\\n   \"Sirius Black,\" he said, nodding. \"\\'Course \\'e was on the Muggle news, Neville, where you been?\"\\n   He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry\\'s face, removed the front page, and handed it to Harry.\\n   \"You oughta read the papers more, Neville.\"\\n   Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:\\n   \\n    THIS STATE OF THE ART RACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM LINED, SUPERFINE HANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND HARD POLISH AND HANDNUMBERED WITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED BIRCH TWIG IN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC PERFECTION, GIVING THE FIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION. THE FIREBOLT HAS AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND INCORPORATES AN UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.\\n    \"We are doing all we can to recapture Black,\" said the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, \"and we beg the magical community to remain calm.\"\\n    Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.\\n    \"Well, really, I had to, don\\'t you know,\" said an irritable Fudge. \"Black is mad. He\\'s a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the Prime Minister\\'s assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black\\'s true identity to anyone. And-let\\'s face it-who\\'d believe him if he did?\"\\n   \"\\'Bye, Neville!\" called Stan.\\n   Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom\\'s lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.\\n   \"So all that remains,\" said Fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, \"is to decide where you\\'re going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and-\"\\n   \"Hang on,\" said Harry quickly, \"I\\'ve already got one of those.\"\\n   \"He didn\\'t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?\" said Hermione.\\n   \"Anything else?\" he said.\\n   \"You \\'ave this one,\" Stan whispered, shoving Harry\\'s trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel. \"This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This is Neville Longbottom, Ern.\"\\n   Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed.\\n   \"Talk about summat else, Stan, there\\'s a good lad. Them Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.\"\\n   Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn\\'t help imagining what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights\\' time.\\n   \"\\'Ere you go, Madam Marsh,\" said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the way.\\n   Harry wouldn\\'t have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didn\\'t keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet.\\n   Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He looked strangely familiar.\\n   \"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron\\'s hand. \"And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what\\'s the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he\\'d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.\"\\n   \"Would we get a reward if we caught him?\" asked Ron. \"It\\'d be good to get some more money-\"\\n   \"Don\\'t want to lose you again, do we?\" said Fudge with a hearty laugh. \"No, no... best we know where you are... I mean...\"\\n   Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.\\n   \"Well, I\\'m taking more new subjects than you, aren\\'t I?\" said Hermione. \"Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies-\"\\n   \"What didja call Neville, Minister?\" he said excitedly.\\n   Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted.\\n   \"No, I don\\'t think so,\" said Hermione composedly. \"I really want an owl. I mean, Harry\\'s got Hedwig and you\\'ve got Errol-\"\\n   \"I hope you\\'re well?\" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced to the mayor.\\n   \"We tried to shut him in a pyramid,\" he told Harry. \"But Mum spotted us.\"\\n   Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.\\n   \"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\" he said, \"and I don\\'t ever want to go back to Privet Drive.\"\\n   \"Of course I don\\'t,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Well, Harry,\" said Fudge, pouring out tea, \"you\\'ve had us all in a right flap, I don\\'t mind telling you.

I\\'d started to think... but you\\'re safe, and that\\'s what matters.\"\\n   Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.\\n   \"Er-\" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers.

Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.\\n   \"Sirius Black,\" he said, nodding. \"\\'Course \\'e was on the Muggle news, Neville, where you been?\"\\n   He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry\\'s face, removed the front page, and handed it to Harry.\\n   \"You oughta read the papers more, Neville.\"\\n   Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:\\n   \\n    THIS STATE OF THE ART RACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM LINED, SUPERFINE HANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND HARD POLISH AND HANDNUMBERED WITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED BIRCH TWIG IN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC PERFECTION, GIVING THE FIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION. THE FIREBOLT HAS AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND INCORPORATES AN UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.\\n    \"We are doing all we can to recapture Black,\" said the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, \"and we beg the magical community to remain calm.\"\\n    Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.\\n    \"Well, really, I had to, don\\'t you know,\" said an irritable Fudge. \"Black is mad. He\\'s a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the Prime Minister\\'s assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black\\'s true identity to anyone. And-let\\'s face it-who\\'d believe him if he did?\"\\n   \"\\'Bye, Neville!\" called Stan.\\n   Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom\\'s lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.\\n   \"So all that remains,\" said Fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, \"is to decide where you\\'re going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and-\"\\n   \"Hang on,\" said Harry quickly, \"I\\'ve already got one of those.\"\\n   \"He didn\\'t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?\" said Hermione.\\n   \"Anything else?\" he said.\\n   \"You \\'ave this one,\" Stan whispered, shoving Harry\\'s trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel. \"This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This is Neville Longbottom, Ern.\"\\n   Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed.\\n   \"Talk about summat else, Stan, there\\'s a good lad. Them Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.\"\\n   Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn\\'t help imagining what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights\\' time.\\n   \"\\'Ere you go, Madam Marsh,\" said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the way.\\n   Harry wouldn\\'t have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didn\\'t keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet.\\n   Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He looked strangely familiar.\\n   \"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron\\'s hand. \"And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what\\'s the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he\\'d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.\"\\n   \"Would we get a reward if we caught him?\" asked Ron. \"It\\'d be good to get some more money-\"\\n   \"Don\\'t want to lose you again, do we?\" said Fudge with a hearty laugh. \"No, no... best we know where you are... I mean...\"\\n   Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.\\n   \"Well, I\\'m taking more new subjects than you, aren\\'t I?\" said Hermione. \"Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies-\"\\n   \"What didja call Neville, Minister?\" he said excitedly.\\n   Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted.\\n   \"No, I don\\'t think so,\" said Hermione composedly. \"I really want an owl. I mean, Harry\\'s got Hedwig and you\\'ve got Errol-\"\\n   \"I hope you\\'re well?\" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced to the mayor.\\n   \"We tried to shut him in a pyramid,\" he told Harry. \"But Mum spotted us.\"\\n   Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.\\n   \"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\" he said, \"and I don\\'t ever want to go back to Privet Drive.\"\\n   \"Of course I don\\'t,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Well, Harry,\" said Fudge, pouring out tea, \"you\\'ve had us all in a right flap, I don\\'t mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle\\'s house like that! I\\'d started to think... but you\\'re safe, and that\\'s what matters.\"\\n   Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.\\n   \"Er-\" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers. The witch\\'s eyes moved from Scabbers\\'s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.\\n   \"He\\'s gorgeous, isn\\'t he?\" said Hermione, glowing.\\n   That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat\\'s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in Hermione\\'s arms.\\n   \"Hm,\" said the witch, picking up Scabbers. \"How old is this rat?\"\\n   \"Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then... You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that\\'s that, and no harm done.\"\\n   Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn\\'t believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn\\'t think of anything to say, and closed it again.\\n   \"Ah,\" he said. \"No, no, I\\'m very sorry, Harry, but as I\\'m not your parent or guardian-\"\\n   \"Bye,\" Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar.\\n   \"\\'Ear about that \\'Arry Potter? Blew up \\'is aunt! We \\'ad \\'im \\'ere on the Knight Bus, di\\'n\\'t we, Ern? \\'E was tryin\\' to run for it...\"\\n   He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn\\'t know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he\\'d ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last year. Harry wouldn\\'t soon forget the look of terror on Hagrid\\'s face when he had been told where he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.\\n   The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry\\'s pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.\\n   Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.\\n   \"Righto,\" said Stan. \"\\'Old tight, then.\"\\n   BANG.\\n   They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus\\'s way. The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the moment it opened, then set off-where, he didn\\'t know.\\n   Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabbylooking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.\\n   \"That man!\" Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. \"He was on the Muggle news!\"\\n   Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.\\n   \"Sit down, Harry,\" said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.\\n   Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle green suit and sat down opposite Harry.\\n   \"I broke the law!\" Harry said. \"The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!\"\\n   \"Okay,\" said Harry slowly, \"but why?\"\\n   \"Dunno,\" said Ron. \"Quite old. He used to belong to my brother.\"\\n   \"What was that?\"\\n   \"It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing-\"\\n   \"I haven\\'t,\" said Ron. \"Errol\\'s a family owl. All I\\'ve got is Scabbers.\" He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. \"And I want to get him checked over,\" he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. \"I don\\'t think Egypt agreed with him.\"\\n   Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to his whiskers.\\n   \"They \\'ad a job coverin\\' it up, din\\' they, Ern?\" Stan said. \"\\'Ole street blown up an\\' all them Muggles dead. What was it they said ad \\'appened, Ern?\"\\n   \"Get out of the way,\" said the m\\n    5. THE DEMENTOR\\n    5. THE DEMENTOR\\n    5. THE DEMENTOR\\n    5. THE DEMENTOR\\n    5.

THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE\\n   \\n   When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As they passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter.\\n   \"Ignore him,\" said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. \"Just ignore him, it\\'s not worth it...\"\\n   \"Hey, Potter!\" shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face like a pug. \"Potter! The Dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooooo!\"\\n   Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to George Weasley.\\n   \"New third year course schedules,\" said George, passing then, over. \"What\\'s up with you, Harry?\"\\n   \"Malfoy,\" said Ron, sitting down on George\\'s other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table.\\n   George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror again.\\n   \"That little git,\" he said calmly. \"He wasn\\'t so cocky last night when the Dementors were down at our end of the train. Came runing into our compartment, didn\\'t he, Fred?\"\\n   \"Nearly wet himself,\" said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy.\\n   \"I wasn\\'t too happy myself,\" said George. \"They\\'re horrible things, those Dementors...\"\\n   \"Sort of freeze your insides, don\\'t they?\" said Fred.\\n   \"You didn\\'t pass out, though, did you?\" said Harry in a low voice.\\n   \"Forget it, Harry,\" said George bracingly. \"Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he\\'d ever been, he came back all weak and shaking... They suck the happiness out of a place, Dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there.\"\\n   \"Are you all right?\" said Harry, moving closer to the picture.\\n   \"Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!\"\\n   The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he couldn\\'t get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face.\\n   \"Listen,\" said Harry, taking advantage of the knight\\'s exhaustion, \"we\\'re looking for the North Tower. You don\\'t know the way, do you?\"\\n   \"After you,\" said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.\\n   He emerged into the strangest looking classroom he had ever seen. In fact, it didn\\'t look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between someone\\'s attic and an old fashioned tea shop. At least twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. It was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty looking feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups.\\n   Ron appeared at Harry\\'s shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers.\\n   \"Where is she?\" Ron said.\\n   A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.\\n   \"Welcome,\" it said. \"How nice to see you in the physical world at last.\"\\n   Harry\\'s immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect. Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings.\\n   \"Sit, my children, sit,\" she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves around the same round table.\\n   \"Welcome to Divination,\" said Professor Trelawney, who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. \"My name is Professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.\"\\n   Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, \"So you have chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is very little I will be able to teach you.. Books can take you only so far in this field...\"\\n   At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn\\'t be much help in this subject.\\n   \"Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future,\" Professor Trelawney went on, her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. \"It is a Gift granted to few. You, boy,\" she said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off his pouf. \"Is your grandmother well?\"\\n   \"I think so,\" said Neville tremulously.\\n   \"I wouldn\\'t be so sure if I were you, dear,\" said Professor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville gulped. Professor Trelawney continued placidly. \"We will be covering the basic methods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,\" she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, \"beware a red haired man.\"\\n   Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him.\\n   \"In the second term,\" Professor Trelawney went on, \"we shall progress to the crystal ball-if we have finished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever.\"\\n   A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of it.\\n   \"I wonder, dear,\" she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank back in her chair, \"if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?\"\\n   Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the shelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney.\\n   \"Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading-it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October.\"\\n   Lavender trembled.\\n   \"Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the shelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to read. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing. Oh, and dear\"-she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up-\"after you\\'ve broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? I\\'m rather attached to the pink.\"\\n   Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said, \"One of the blue ones, then, dear, if you wouldn\\'t mind... thank you...\"\\n   When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled the dregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the cups and swapped over.\\n   \"Right,\" said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six. \"What can you see in mine?\"\\n   \"A quest!\" The knight\\'s rage seemed to vanish instantly. He clanked to his feet and shouted, \"Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!\"\\n   He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, \"On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady! On! On!\"\\n   And he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out of sight.\\n   They hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his armor. Every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead.\\n   \"Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the mundane!\" Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom.\\n   Harry tried to pull himself together.\\n   \"Right, you\\'ve got a crooked sort of cross...\" He consulted Unfogging the Future. \"That means you\\'re going to have \\'trials and suffering\\'-sorry about that-but there\\'s a thing that could be the sun... hang on... that means \\'great happiness\\'... so you\\'re going to suffer but be very happy...\"\\n   \"You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,\" said Ron, and they both had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their direction.\\n   \"My turn...\" Ron peered into Harry\\'s teacup, his forehead wrinkled with effort. \"There\\'s a blob a bit like a bowler hat,\" he said. \"Maybe you\\'re going to work for the Ministry of Magic...\"\\n   He turned the teacup the other way up.\\n   \"But, sir-!\"\\n   Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.\\n   \"Now,\" said Snape in his most dangerous voice.\\n   Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at Malfoy, then took up the knife again.\\n   \"Anyway, we\\'ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch match,\" said Fred. \"Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?\"\\n   The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.\\n   Hermione was examining her new schedule.\\n   \"Ooh, good, we\\'re starting some new subjects today,\" she said happily.\\n   \"Hermione,\" said Ron, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, \"they\\'ve messed up your schedule. Look-they\\'ve got you down for about ten subjects a day. There isn\\'t enough time.\"\\n   \"I\\'ll manage. I\\'ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.\"\\n   \"But this way it looks more like an acorn... What\\'s that?\" He scanned his copy of Unfogging the Future. \"\\'A windfall, unexpected gold.\\' Excellent, you can lend me some... and there\\'s a thin, here,\" he turned the cup again, \"that looks like an animal... yeah, if that was its head... it looks like a hippo... no, a sheep...\"\\n   Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter.\\n   \"Let me see that, my dear,\" she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry\\'s cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch.\\n   Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it counterclockwise.\\n   \"The falcon... my dear, you have a deadly enemy.\"\\n   \"But look,\" said Ron, laughing, \"see this morning? Nine o\\'clock, Divination. And underneath, nine o\\'clock, Muggle Studies. And\"-Ron leaned closer to the schedule, disbelieving-\"look-underneath that, Arithmacy, nine o\\'clock. I mean, I know you\\'re good, Hermione, but no one\\'s that good. How\\'re you supposed to be in three classes at once?\"\\n   \"Don\\'t be silly,\" said Hermione shortly. \"Of course I won\\'t be in three classes at once.\"\\n   \"Well, then-\"\\n   \"Pass the marmalade,\" said Hermione.\\n   \"C\\'mon!\" Hagrid said angrily. \"I\\'m takin\\' yer all back up ter school, an\\' don\\' let me catch yeh walkin\\' down ter see me after dark again. I\\'m not worth that!\"\\n  \\n   \\n   \"\\'Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,\\'\" Harry read. \"How\\'re we supposed to get up there?\"\\n   As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended right at Harry\\'s feet. Everyone got quiet.\\n   \"Ah, of course,\" said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning.\\n   \"There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this year?\"\\n   Everyone stared at her.\\n   \"Me,\" said Harry, finally.\\n   \"I see,\" said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes. \"Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues-\" Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone white. She went on, more calmly, \"Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney-\"\\n   She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter of fact tone, \"You look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don\\'t let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in.\"\\n   Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of Professor Trelawney\\'s classroom. Not everyone was convinced, however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, \"But what about Neville\\'s cup?\"\\n   When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch.\\n   \"Ron, cheer up,\" said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him. \"You heard what Professor McGonagall said.\"\\n   Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn\\'t start.\\n   \"Harry,\" he said, in a low, serious voice, \"You haven\\'t seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?\"\\n   \"Yeah, I have,\" said Harry. \"I saw one the night I left the Dursleys\\'.\"\\n   Ron let his fork fall with a clatter.\\n   \"Probably a stray,\" said Hermione calmly.\\n   Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad.\\n   \"Hermione, if Harry\\'s seen a Grim, that\\'s-that\\'s bad,\" he said. \"My-my uncle Bilius saw one and-and he died twenty four hours later!\"\\n   \"Coming through, coming through!\" Percy called from behind the crowd. \"The new password\\'s \\'Fortuna Major\\'!\"\\n   \"Oh no,\" said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always had trouble remembering the passwords.\\n   Through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back. They reached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five four poster beds, and Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last.\\n  \\n   \\n    7. THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE\\n   \\n   When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As they passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter.\\n   \"Ignore him,\" said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. \"Just ignore him, it\\'s not worth it...\"\\n   \"Hey, Potter!\" shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face like a pug. \"Potter! The Dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooooo!\"\\n   Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to George Weasley.\\n   \"New third year course schedules,\" said George, passing then, over. \"What\\'s up with you, Harry?\"\\n   \"Malfoy,\" said Ron, sitting down on George\\'s other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table.\\n   George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror again.\\n   \"That little git,\" he said calmly. \"He wasn\\'t so cocky last night when the Dementors were down at our end of the train. Came runing into our compartment, didn\\'t he, Fred?\"\\n   \"Nearly wet himself,\" said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy.\\n   \"I wasn\\'t too happy myself,\" said George. \"They\\'re horrible things, those Dementors...\"\\n   \"Sort of freeze your insides, don\\'t they?\" said Fred.\\n   \"You didn\\'t pass out, though, did you?\" said Harry in a low voice.\\n   \"Forget it, Harry,\" said George bracingly. \"Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he\\'d ever been, he came back all weak and shaking... They suck the happiness out of a place, Dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there.\"\\n   \"Are you all right?\" said Harry, moving closer to the picture.\\n   \"Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!\"\\n   The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he couldn\\'t get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face.\\n   \"Listen,\" said Harry, taking advantage of the knight\\'s exhaustion, \"we\\'re looking for the North Tower. You don\\'t know the way, do you?\"\\n   \"After you,\" said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.\\n   He emerged into the strangest looking classroom he had ever seen. In fact, it didn\\'t look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between someone\\'s attic and an old fashioned tea shop. At least twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. It was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty looking feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups.\\n   Ron appeared at Harry\\'s shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers.\\n   \"Where is she?\" Ron said.\\n   A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.\\n   \"Welcome,\" it said. \"How nice to see you in the physical world at last.\"\\n   Harry\\'s immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect. Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings.\\n   \"Sit, my children, sit,\" she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves around the same round table.\\n   \"Welcome to Divination,\" said Professor Trelawney, who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. \"My name is Professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.\"\\n   Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, \"So you have chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is very little I will be able to teach you.. Books can take you only so far in this field...\"\\n   At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn\\'t be much help in this subject.\\n   \"Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future,\" Professor Trelawney went on, her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. \"It is a Gift granted to few. You, boy,\" she said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off his pouf. \"Is your grandmother well?\"\\n   \"I think so,\" said Neville tremulously.\\n   \"I wouldn\\'t be so sure if I were you, dear,\" said Professor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville gulped. Professor Trelawney continued placidly. \"We will be covering the basic methods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,\" she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, \"beware a red haired man.\"\\n   Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him.\\n   \"In the second term,\" Professor Trelawney went on, \"we shall progress to the crystal ball-if we have finished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever.\"\\n   A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of it.\\n   \"I wonder, dear,\" she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank back in her chair, \"if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?\"\\n   Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the shelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney.\\n   \"Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading-it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October.\"\\n   Lavender trembled.\\n   \"Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the shelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to read. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing. Oh, and dear\"-she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up-\"after you\\'ve broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? I\\'m rather attached to the pink.\"\\n   Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said, \"One of the blue ones, then, dear, if you wouldn\\'t mind... thank you...\"\\n   When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled the dregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the cups and swapped over.\\n   \"Right,\" said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six. \"What can you see in mine?\"\\n   \"A quest!\" The knight\\'s rage seemed to vanish instantly. He clanked to his feet and shouted, \"Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!\"\\n   He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, \"On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady!

Every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead.\\n   \"Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the mundane!\" Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom.\\n   Harry tried to pull himself together.\\n   \"Right, you\\'ve got a crooked sort of cross...\" He consulted Unfogging the Future. \"That means you\\'re going to have \\'trials and suffering\\'-sorry about that-but there\\'s a thing that could be the sun... hang on... that means \\'great happiness\\'... so you\\'re going to suffer but be very happy...\"\\n   \"You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,\" said Ron, and they both had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their direction.\\n   \"My turn...\" Ron peered into Harry\\'s teacup, his forehead wrinkled with effort. \"There\\'s a blob a bit like a bowler hat,\" he said. \"Maybe you\\'re going to work for the Ministry of Magic...\"\\n   He turned the teacup the other way up.\\n   \"But, sir-!\"\\n   Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.\\n   \"Now,\" said Snape in his most dangerous voice.\\n   Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at Malfoy, then took up the knife again.\\n   \"Anyway, we\\'ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch match,\" said Fred. \"Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?\"\\n   The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.\\n   Hermione was examining her new schedule.\\n   \"Ooh, good, we\\'re starting some new subjects today,\" she said happily.\\n   \"Hermione,\" said Ron, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, \"they\\'ve messed up your schedule. Look-they\\'ve got you down for about ten subjects a day. There isn\\'t enough time.\"\\n   \"I\\'ll manage. I\\'ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.\"\\n   \"But this way it looks more like an acorn... What\\'s that?\" He scanned his copy of Unfogging the Future. \"\\'A windfall, unexpected gold.\\' Excellent, you can lend me some... and there\\'s a thin, here,\" he turned the cup again, \"that looks like an animal... yeah, if that was its head... it looks like a hippo... no, a sheep...\"\\n   Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter.\\n   \"Let me see that, my dear,\" she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry\\'s cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch.\\n   Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it counterclockwise.\\n   \"The falcon... my dear, you have a deadly enemy.\"\\n   \"But look,\" said Ron, laughing, \"see this morning? Nine o\\'clock, Divination. And underneath, nine o\\'clock, Muggle Studies. And\"-Ron leaned closer to the schedule, disbelieving-\"look-underneath that, Arithmacy, nine o\\'clock. I mean, I know you\\'re good, Hermione, but no one\\'s that good. How\\'re you supposed to be in three classes at once?\"\\n   \"Don\\'t be silly,\" said Hermione shortly. \"Of course I won\\'t be in three classes at once.\"\\n   \"Well, then-\"\\n   \"Pass the marmalade,\" said Hermione.\\n   \"C\\'mon!\" Hagrid said angrily. \"I\\'m takin\\' yer all back up ter school, an\\' don\\' let me catch yeh walkin\\' down ter see me after dark again. I\\'m not worth that!\"\\n  \\n   \\n   \"\\'Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,\\'\" Harry read. \"How\\'re we supposed to get up there?\"\\n   As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended right at Harry\\'s feet. Everyone got quiet.\\n   \"Ah, of course,\" said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning.\\n   \"There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this year?\"\\n   Everyone stared at her.\\n   \"Me,\" said Harry, finally.\\n   \"I see,\" said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes. \"Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues-\" Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone white. She went on, more calmly, \"Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney-\"\\n   She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter of fact tone, \"You look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don\\'t let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in.\"\\n   Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of Professor Trelawney\\'s classroom. Not everyone was convinced, however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, \"But what about Neville\\'s cup?\"\\n   When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch.\\n   \"Ron, cheer up,\" said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him. \"You heard what Professor McGonagall said.\"\\n   Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn\\'t start.\\n   \"Harry,\" he said, in a low, serious voice, \"You haven\\'t seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?\"\\n   \"Yeah, I have,\" said Harry. \"I saw one the night I left the Dursleys\\'.\"\\n   Ron let his fork fall with a clatter.\\n   \"Probably a stray,\" said Hermione calmly.\\n   Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad.\\n   \"Hermione, if Harry\\'s seen a Grim, that\\'s-that\\'s bad,\" he said. \"My-my uncle Bilius saw one and-and he died twenty four hours later!\"\\n   \"Coming through, coming through!\" Percy called from behind the crowd. \"The new password\\'s \\'Fortuna Major\\'!\"\\n   \"Oh no,\" said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always had trouble remembering the passwords.\\n   Through the portrait hole and across the commo\\n    8. FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY\\n    8. FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY\\n    8.

But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker\\'s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry\\'s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else.\\n   This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them seemed to lead-\\n   \"Right into Hogsmeade,\" said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. \"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four\"-he pointed them out-\"but we\\'re sure we\\'re the only ones who know about these. Don\\'t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it\\'s caved in-completely blocked. And we don\\'t reckon anyone\\'s ever used this one, because the Whomping Willow\\'s planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We\\'ve used it loads of times. And as you might\\'ve noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone\\'s hump.\"\\n   \"Moony, Wormtaill, Padfoot, and Prongs,\" sighed George, patting the heading of the map. \"We owe them so much.\"\\n   \"Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,\" said Fred solemnly.\\n   \"Right,\" said George briskly. \"Don\\'t forget to wipe it after you\\'ve used it or anyone can read it,\" Fred said warningly.\\n   \"Just tap it again and say, \\'Mischief managed!\\' And it\\'ll go blank.\"\\n   \"So, young Harry,\" said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy, \"mind you behave yourself.\"\\n   \"See you in Honeydukes,\" said George, winking.\\n   They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way.\\n   Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If Filch really didn\\'t know... he wouldn\\'t have to pass the Dementors at all...\\n   But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory.\\n   Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can\\'t see where it keeps its brain.\\n   This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been warning against... Aids for Magical Mischief-Makers... but then, Harry reasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn\\'t as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone... and Fred and George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening...\\n   Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger.\\n   Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map, stuffed it inside his robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom. He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the one-eyed witch.\\n   What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry Potter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was standing, about halfway down the third floor corridor.\\n   Harry watched carefully. His little Ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside said, \"Dissendium.\"\\n   \"Dissendium!\" Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.\\n   At once, the statue\\'s hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed himself forward.\\n   He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, \"Lumos!\" and saw that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped it with the tip of his wand, and muttered, \"Mischief managed!\" The map went blank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off.\\n   The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.\\n   It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him. After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.\\n   Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which rose out of sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry began to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he climbed, watching his feet... Then, without warning, his head hit something hard.\\n   It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his head, listening. He couldn\\'t hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.\\n   He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it-it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he could definitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door.\\n   Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.\\n   \"And it hit-it hit-oh, Harry-it hit the Whomping Willow.\"\\n   Harry\\'s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.\\n   \"And?\" he said, dreading the answer.\\n   \"Well, you know the Whomping Willow,\" said Ron. \"It-it doesn\\'t like being hit.\"\\n   \"Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around,\" said Hermione in a very small voice.\\n   Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry\\'s faithful, finally beaten broomstick.\\n  \\n   \\n    11. THE FIREBOLT\\n   \\n   It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker\\'s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry\\'s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else.\\n   This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them seemed to lead-\\n   \"Right into Hogsmeade,\" said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. \"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four\"-he pointed them out-\"but we\\'re sure we\\'re the only ones who know about these. Don\\'t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it\\'s caved in-completely blocked. And we don\\'t reckon anyone\\'s ever used this one, because the Whomping Willow\\'s planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We\\'ve used it loads of times. And as you might\\'ve noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone\\'s hump.\"\\n   \"Moony, Wormtaill, Padfoot, and Prongs,\" sighed George, patting the heading of the map. \"We owe them so much.\"\\n   \"Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,\" said Fred solemnly.\\n   \"Right,\" said George briskly. \"Don\\'t forget to wipe it after you\\'ve used it or anyone can read it,\" Fred said warningly.\\n   \"Just tap it again and say, \\'Mischief managed!\\' And it\\'ll go blank.\"\\n   \"So, young Harry,\" said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy, \"mind you behave yourself.\"\\n   \"See you in Honeydukes,\" said George, winking.\\n   They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way.\\n   Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If Filch really didn\\'t know... he wouldn\\'t have to pass the Dementors at all...\\n   But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory.\\n   Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can\\'t see where it keeps its brain.\\n   This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been warning against... Aids for Magical Mischief-Makers... but then, Harry reasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn\\'t as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone... and Fred and George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening...\\n   Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger.\\n   Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map, stuffed it inside his robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom. He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the one-eyed witch.\\n   What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry Potter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was standing, about halfway down the third floor corridor.\\n   Harry watched carefully. His little Ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside said, \"Dissendium.\"\\n   \"Dissendium!\" Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.\\n   At once, the statue\\'s hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed himself forward.\\n   He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, \"Lumos!\" and saw that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway.

Aids for Magical Mischief-Makers... but then, Harry reasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn\\'t as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone... and Fred and George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening...\\n   Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger.\\n   Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map, stuffed it inside his robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom. He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the one-eyed witch.\\n   What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry Potter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was standing, about halfway down the third floor corridor.\\n   Harry watched carefully. His little Ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside said, \"Dissendium.\"\\n   \"Dissendium!\" Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.\\n   At once, the statue\\'s hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed himself forward.\\n   He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, \"Lumos!\" and saw that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped it with the tip of his wand, and muttered, \"Mischief managed!\" The map went blank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off.\\n   The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.\\n   It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him. After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.\\n   Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which rose out of sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry began to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he climbed, watching his feet... Then, without warning, his head hit something hard.\\n   It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his head, listening. He couldn\\'t hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.\\n   He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it-it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he could definitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door.\\n   Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.\\n   \"And it hit-it hit-oh, Harry-it hit the Whomping Willow.\"\\n   Harry\\'s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.\\n   \"And?\" he said, dreading the answer.\\n   \"Well, you know the Whomping Willow,\" said Ron. \"It-it doesn\\'t like being hit.\"\\n   \"Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around,\" said Hermione in a very small voice.\\n   Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry\\'s faithful, finally beaten broomstick.\\n  \\n   \\n    11. THE FIREBOLT\\n   \\n   It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker\\'s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry\\'s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else.\\n   This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them seemed to lead-\\n   \"Right into Hogsmeade,\" said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. \"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four\"-he pointed them out-\"but we\\'re sure we\\'re the only ones who know about these. Don\\'t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it\\'s caved in-completely blocked. And we don\\'t reckon anyone\\'s ever used this one, because the Whomping Willow\\'s planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We\\'ve used it loads of times. And as you might\\'ve noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone\\'s hump.\"\\n   \"Moony, Wormtaill, Padfoot, and Prongs,\" sighed George, patting the heading of the map. \"We owe them so much.\"\\n   \"Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,\" said Fred solemnly.\\n   \"Right,\" said George briskly. \"Don\\'t forget to wipe it after you\\'ve used it or anyone can read it,\" Fred said warningly.\\n   \"Just tap it again and say, \\'Mischief managed!\\' And it\\'ll go blank.\"\\n   \"So, young Harry,\" said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy, \"mind you behave yourself.\"\\n   \"See you in Honeydukes,\" said George, winking.\\n   They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way.\\n   Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If Filch really didn\\'t know... he wouldn\\'t have to pass the Dementors at all...\\n   But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory.\\n   Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can\\'t see where it keeps its brain.\\n   This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been warning against...

SNAPE\\'S GRUDGE\\n    13. GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW\\n   \\n   No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle was being searched again, and the whole House stayed awake in the common room, waiting to hear whether Black had been caught. Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped.\\n   Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely nervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs.\\n   Harry didn\\'t have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione\\'s impossible schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape\\'s essay. Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood.\\n   \"Because her cat acted like all cats do,\" Hagrid continued doggedly. \"She\\'s cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin\\' through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more\\'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she\\'s tryin\\' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak\\'s case, mind... She\\'s found some really good stuff fer me... reckon he\\'ll stand a good chance now...\"\\n  \\n  \\n   \\n    Hagrid\\n   \\n   It was better than he\\'d ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green and gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again.\\n   \"Harry, I\\'ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It\\'s Cho Chang. She\\'s a fourth year, and she\\'s pretty good... I really hoped she wouldn\\'t be fit, she\\'s had some problems with injuries...\" Wood scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, \"On the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt.\" He gave Harry\\'s broom a look of fervent admiration, then said, \"Okay, everyone, let\\'s go-\"\\n   At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms. The weather couldn\\'t have been more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn\\'t need it. He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.\\n   \"You said it\\'s harder if there are loads of them,\" said Harry.\\n   \"I see,\" said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. \"Well-let\\'s drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I\\'m supposed to take sides, as a teacher...\" he added hastily.\\n   They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he\\'d been wondering for a while.\\n   \"What-they kill-?\"\\n   \"Oh!\" screamed Cho, pointing.\\n   Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right behind him.\\n   \"Yeah, that\\'s true,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Hmmm... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us. You see, the Dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon.\"\\n   \"What\\'s the matter?\" said Ron.\\n   Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black.\\n   \"He had \\'em!\" said Sir Cadogan proudly. \"Had the whole week\\'s, my lady! Read \\'em off a little piece of paper!\"\\n   Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd. She was white as chalk.\\n   \"Who shouted?\"\\n   \"What\\'s all the noise?\"\\n   \"Put it here, Harry,\" he said, laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. People from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look. Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy\\'s Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt.\\n   \"Now, really, enough\\'s enough!\"\\n   Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously around.\\n   \"I can have it back?\" Harry said weakly. \"Seriously?\"\\n   \"She gave it to you? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it? Tomorrow?\"\\n   \"Yes!\" Ron yelled, yanking Harry\\'s arm into the air. \"Yes! Yes!\"\\n   \"Well, let\\'s hope not,\" said Wood. \"Anyway-good work, everyone. Let\\'s get back to the tower... turn in early-\"\\n   \"I\\'m telling you, I saw him!\"\\n   \"What\\'s going on?\"\\n   Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to some of Neville\\'s cornflakes. The note inside said:\\n   \\n   \"Here you go,\" said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.\\n   Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of the field, watching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that they go back to the castle.\\n   Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle\\'s shoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall.\\n   \"Are you sure you weren\\'t dreaming, Ron?\"\\n   \"I\\'m telling you-\"\\n   \"Oddsbodikins,\" said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his Firebolt.\\n   \"Which person,\" she said, her voice shaking, \"which abysmally foolish person wrote down this week\\'s passwords and left them lying around?\"\\n   There was utter silence, broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks. Neville Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes, raised his hand slowly into the air.\\n  \\n   \\n    Cheers,\\n    How about having tea with me this afternoon \\'round six? I\\'ll come collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL; YOU\\'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN.\\n    Dear Harry and Ron,\\n   \"-ate Scabbers!\" Ron interjected angrily.\\n   \"Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!\"\\n   \"What?\" said Harry.\\n   \"His finest hour,\" said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. \"Let the scar on Goyle\\'s finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. Oh, come on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what\\'s the point of moaning?\"\\n   It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets.\\n   \"How\\'s she doing it?\" Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books.\\n   \"Don\\'t be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole?\"\\n   \"BLOOD!\" Ron yelled into the stunned silence. \"HE\\'S GONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?\"\\n   \"No, Potter, you can\\'t have it back yet,\" Professor McGonagall told him the twelfth time this happened, before he\\'d even opened his mouth. \"We\\'ve checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you once we\\'ve finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me.\"\\n   To make matters even worse, Harry\\'s anti Dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the Boggart Dementor approached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the Dementor away. All it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself, guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents\\' voices again.\\n   \"You-you did?\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But-but the password!\"\\n   \"He must\\'ve known he\\'d have a job getting back out of the castle once you\\'d yelled and woken people up,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He\\'d\\'ve had to kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole... then he would\\'ve met the teachers...\"\\n   Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him. None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him. Two days after Black\\'s break in, she sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive over breakfast-a Howler.\\n   The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual, and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once-Ron had got one from his mother the year before.\\n   \"SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!\"\\n   If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor\\'s victory, it was this. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry\\'s side, doubled up with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe, Goyle\\'s head still stuck inside it.\\n   \"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,\" Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.\\n   \"I certainly didn\\'t authorize this, Professor!\" said Percy, puffing himself up indignantly. \"I was just telling them all to get back to bed! My brother Ron here had a nightmare-\"\\n   \"JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!\"\\n   Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty points ahead-if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically-a glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings-the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post-\\n   Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.\\n   \"What?\"\\n   \"Hermione,\" said Hagrid.\\n   \"What are they for, Hagrid?\" said Harry.\\n   \"Butterbeer!\" said Harry, without thinking. \"Yeah, I like that stuff!\"\\n   Lupin\\'s face relaxed.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry defiantly. \"For... for some things...\"\\n   Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls\\' dormitories and out of sight.\\n   \"Certainly, good lady!\" cried Sir Cadogan.\\n   There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room.\\n   * * *\\n   Harry woke as suddenly as though he\\'d been hit in the face. Disoriented in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings, he could hear movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan\\'s voice from the other side of the room:\\n   \"What\\'s that?\"\\n   \"They\\'re dead,\" he told himself sternly. \"They\\'re dead and listening to echoes of them won\\'t bring them back. You\\'d better get a grip on yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup.\"\\n   He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass, carried it away up the boys\\' staircase.\\n   \"Can\\'t you give her a break?\" Harry asked Ron quietly.\\n   \"Nonsense!\" said Percy, looking startled. \"You had too much to eat, Ron-had a nightmare-\"\\n   \"I\\'ve already heard all abou\\' it,\" said Hagrid, opening the front doors and leading them outside.\\n   \"Oh-Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,\" Harry lied quickly.\\n   \"I suppose so,\" said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a chair.\\n   Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, \"Lumos!\"\\n   A few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling on dressing gowns and yawning. Boys, too, were reappearing.\\n   \"Fred!\" said Ginny indignantly.\\n   \"All right, Hagrid!\" said Ron. \"S\\'pose you want to hear about Saturday night, do you?\"\\n   \"I\\'ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. Well, here it is, we\\'ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn\\'t seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You\\'ve got a very good friend somewhere, Potter...\"\\n   He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on the Snitch with every second-then\\n   \"Oh, shut up,\" said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville.\\n   \"IT WASN\\'T A NIGHTMARE!\" Ron yelled. \"PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!\"\\n   Professor McGonagall stared at him.\\n   \"Everyone back upstairs!\" said Percy, hurrying into the common room and pinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.\\n   \"Pity you can\\'t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,\" said Harry. \"Then it could catch the Snitch for you.\"\\n   The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy\\'s pale eyes narrowed, and he stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry\\'s broom really was a Firebolt.\\n   But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out. At that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys\\' staircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder-and then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.\\n   \"LOOK!\" he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.\\n   \"Ruddy brilliant!\" boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling Gryffindors.\\n   \"That would be because they-er-weren\\'t Dementors,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Come and see-\"\\n   He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.\\n   \"Can I just hold it, Harry?\"\\n   And at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and kicked off from the ground.\\n   It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn\\'t have a single criticism to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first.\\n   \"I can\\'t, Harry. I\\'ve still got four hundred and twenty two pages to read!\" said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. \"Anyway...\" She glanced over at Ron too. \"He doesn\\'t want me to join in.\"\\n   There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, \"If Scabbers hadn\\'t just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them-\"\\n   Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it. Something that looked horribly like-\\n   \"Bad news, Harry. I\\'ve just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt. She-er-got a bit shirty with me. Told me I\\'d got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn\\'t care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first.\" Wood shook his head in disbelief. \"Honestly, the way she was yelling at me... you\\'d think I\\'d said something terrible... then I asked her how much longer she was going to keep it. He screwed up his face and imitated Professor McGonagall\\'s severe voice. \\'As long as necessary, Wood\\'... I reckon it\\'s time you ordered a new broom, Harry. There\\'s an order form at the back of Which Broomstick... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, like Malfoy\\'s got.\"\\n   \"I\\'m staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt,\" Harry told Wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms, Harry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.\\n   \"Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!\"\\n   \"You think so?\" said Lupin lightly. \"Do you really think anyone deserves that?\"\\n   \"You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,\" said Lupin.\\n   Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs.\\n   \"What\\'s under a Dementor\\'s hood?\"\\n   Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully.\\n   \"How are you getting through all this stuff?\" Harry asked her.\\n   \"Oh,\" said Ron, looking slightly put out.\\n   The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid\\'s cabin was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of Hagrid\\'s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets. Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow and orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid\\'s wardrobe door.\\n   \"What\\'re you doing?\"\\n   The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered with the debris from the party. It was deserted.\\n   \"Arithmancy looks terrible,\" said Harry, picking up a very complicated looking number chart.\\n   \"Oh no,\" said Lupin. \"Much worse than that. You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you\\'ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no... anything. There\\'s no chance at all of recovery. You\\'ll just exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever... lost.\"\\n   Lupin raised an eyebrow.\\n   \"Oh-right-here you are, then, Potter,\" said Madam Hooch. \"I\\'ll sit over here with Weasley...\"\\n   She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow\\'s match.\\n   \"Harry-make sure you win,\" said Percy, in an urgent whisper. \"I haven\\'t got ten Galleons. Yes, I\\'m coming, Penny!\" And he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast.\\n   \"That was quite some Patronus,\" said a voice in Harry\\'s ear.\\n   Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw it-the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the barriers.\\n   Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that Buckbeak\\'s trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron\\'s face, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare Buckbeak\\'s defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds.\\n   Hagrid was already waiting for them.\\n   \"An unworthy trick!\" she was shouting. \"A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!\"\\n   In a last ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor team\\'s final practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after they\\'d finished. This did seem to take Ron\\'s mind off Scabbers for a moment (\"Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it?\") so they set off for the Quidditch field together.\\n   Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else had been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion.\\n   \"Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!\"\\n   They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first, and they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, and sleepy voices called after them.\\n   \"Why don\\'t you just drop a couple of subjects?\" Harry asked, watching her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary.\\n   \"I got it back,\" said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt.\\n   \"See?\" Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. \"She\\'s still letting him wander about wherever he wants-probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now...\"\\n   Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him-Harry was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was ten feet away-\\n   Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.\\n   There was a great \"Ooooooh\" of disappointment from the Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it.\\n   \"HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!\" Wood roared as Harry swerved to avoid a collision. \"KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!\"\\n   Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.\\n   The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a minute\\'s head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell\\'s knee, looped her easily, and caught it again.\\n   January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the bitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer, but Harry still hadn\\'t ordered a new broom. He was now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, Ron standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione rushing past with her face averted.\\n   \"No,\" said Ron flatly. \"If she just acted like she was sorry-but she\\'ll never admit she\\'s wrong, Hermione. She\\'s still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something.\"\\n   The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the hangings of his four poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep...\\n   He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field.\\n   \"You know what we\\'ve got to do,\" said Wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms. \"If we lose this match, we\\'re out of the running. Just-just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we\\'ll be okay!\"\\n   They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn\\'t help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn\\'t think had anything to do with nerves.\\n   \"Yeah, I suppose so,\" said Harry. \"I\\'d better put it upstairs.\"\\n   \"I\\'m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,\" said Harry flatly.\\n   * * *\\n   Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin won, though narrowly. According to Wood, this was good news for Gryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He therefore increased the number of team practices to five a leek. This meant that with Lupin\\'s anti Dementor classes, which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a week to do all his homework. Even so, he was showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts, rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted.\\n   \"I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!\"\\n   \"I couldn\\'t do that!\" said Hermione, looking scandalized.\\n   \"Ask him!\" said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir Cadogan\\'s picture. \"Ask him if he saw-\"\\n   Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with Hagrid\\'s cooking.\\n   \"I have complete confidence in you,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Here-you\\'ve earned a drink-something from the Three Broomsticks. You won\\'t have tried it before-\"\\n   He stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth, and headed back to Gryffindor Tower.\\n   A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and illuminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding leaves, was Crookshanks.\\n   \"Getting to all her classes!\" Ron said. \"I heard her talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going on about yesterday\\'s lesson, but Hermione can\\'t\\'ve been there, because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told me she\\'s never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the same time as Divination, and she\\'s never missed one of them either!\"\\n   Harry didn\\'t say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the Grim. They set off for the castle once more. Slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn\\'t say anything to Ron-nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well lit entrance hall.\\n   * * *\\n   It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione\\'s friendship. Each was so angry with the other that Harry couldn\\'t see how they\\'d ever make up.\\n   Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks\\'s attempts to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn\\'t bothered to keep a close enough watch on him, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys\\' beds. Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron\\'s head in the Magical Menagerie.\\n   Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too.\\n   \"Ouch! Oh-thanks, Hedwig.\"\\n   Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had vanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following him... She\\'d decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch herself... All right, then... if she wanted to tail him, she\\'d have to take the consequences...\\n   He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents\\' last moments replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child. But he\\'d never be able to produce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again...\\n   \"They\\'re off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt\\'s going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year\\'s World Championship-\"\\n   \"LOOK!\" he bellowed, striding over to Hermione\\'s table.\\n   \"Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it\\'s a slight list to the tail end-you often find they develop a drag after a few years. They\\'ve updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows-a pity they\\'ve stopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom it was too...\"\\n   She continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, \"Er-Madam Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? We need to practice...\"\\n   \"Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading for goal...\"\\n   Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the divide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit his lamp.\\n   Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of utmost terror on his face.\\n   \"Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal o\\' Dangerous Creatures,\" said Hagrid. \"This Friday. Him an\\' me\\'ll be goin\\' down ter London together. I\\'ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus...\"\\n   Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved twelve years ago that he didn\\'t mind murdering innocent people, and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.\\n   \"He probably wants to hear all about Black!\" said Ron.\\n   So at six o\\'clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left Gryffindor Tower, passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance hall.\\n   Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead-but just then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him-\\n   \"Harry, I\\'m letting the Snitch out!\" Wood called.\\n   Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and pleased.\\n   \"The Dementors won\\'t turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore\\'d go ballistic,\" said Fred confidently.\\n   \"Well-there might have been!\" said Hermione. \"I mean, at least you know now that it\\'s safe!\"\\n   \"Yeah, all right,\" said Ron. \"She\\'s in the common room how working, for a change-\"\\n   They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him entrance.\\n   \"I\\'ll take it!\" said Ron eagerly. \"I\\'ve got to give Scabbers his rat tonic.\"\\n   He would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he\\'d overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying his mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he\\'d gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn\\'t be very impressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the History of Magic classroom.\\n   Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley twins\\' friend Lee Jordan.\\n   \"We know he\\'s not coming in through Honeyduke\\'s,\" said Ron dismissively. \"We\\'d\\'ve heard if the shop had been broken into.\"\\n   Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too. Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist.\\n   \"Perce-Sirius Black!\" said Ron faintly. \"In our dormitory! With a knife! Woke me up!\"\\n   The common room went very still.\\n   \"Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!\" said Percy heartily as she examined the Firebolt closely. \"Penelope and I have got a bet on,\" he told the team. \"Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!\"\\n   Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to her table.\\n   \"Have you ridden it yet, Harry?\"\\n   \"Right you are, Professor-just giving a bit of background information-the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built in auto brake and-\"\\n   \"Jordan, would you mind telling us what\\'s going on in the match?\" interrupted Professor McGonagall\\'s voice.\\n   \"Right,\" said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up to the castle.\\n   * * *\\n   Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, \"It\\'s the fate that awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The Ministry have given the Dementors permission to perform it if they find him.\"\\n   Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt\\'s superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that made his heart turn over-a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness.\\n   Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She was undoubtedly a very good flier-she kept cutting across him, forcing him to change direction.\\n   \"Sorry, Professor-\"\\n   \"I\\'ve lost the passwords!\" Neville told them miserably. \"I made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keeps changing them, and now I don\\'t know what I\\'ve done with them!\"\\n   \"Of course I did,\" said Hermione in a strangely high pitched voice, not looking up. \"And I\\'m very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday.\"\\n   \"Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was,\" said Fred bracingly. \"And he\\'s been off color for ages, he was wasting away. It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly-one swallow-he probably didn\\'t feel a thing.\"\\n   \"Get out of here!\" Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail.\\n   \"Seriously,\" said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. \"I daresay you\\'ll need to get the feel of it before Saturday\\'s match, won\\'t you? And Potter-do try and win, won\\'t you? Or we\\'ll be out of the running for the eighth year. in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night...\"\\n   Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning from ear to ear.\\n   \"She\\'s in a righ\\' state, that\\'s what. She\\'s bin comin\\' down ter visit me a lot since Chris\\'mas. Bin feelin\\' lonely. Firs\\' yeh weren\\' talking to her because o\\' the Firebolt, now yer not talkin\\' to her because her cat-\"\\n   \"...I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was in my dream, you know? But then there was this draft... I woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down... I rolled over... and I saw him standing over me... like a skeleton, with loads of filthy hair... holding this great long knife, must\\'ve been twelve inches... and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled, and he scampered.\"\\n   \"Will you let me have a go?\"\\n   \"He bit Goyle for us once!\" Ron said miserably. \"Remember, Harry?\"\\n   \"Yeah,\" said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were stronger.\\n   \"The true Patronus does do that,\" said Lupin. \"But you\\'ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time. If the Dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground.\"\\n   \"You sure you weren\\'t dreaming, Ron?\" said Dean.\\n   \"Mount your brooms... on my whistle... three-two-one-\"\\n   Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn\\'t mentioned Black, as Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry\\'s thoughts wandered back to his mother and father...\\n   He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his Firebolt over his shoulder, following something silvery white. It was winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run, and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out, and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a clearing and-\\n   \"All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself,\" said George.\\n   \"He deserves it,\" he said suddenly.\\n   \"You\\'re expecting too much of yourself,\" said Professor Lupin, sternly in their fourth week of practice. \"For a thirteen year old wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren\\'t passing out anymore, are you?\"\\n   \"I wrote them down!\" Neville was saying tearfully. \"But I must\\'ve dropped them somewhere!\"\\n   \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGHHHHHHH! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\"\\n   Harry\\'s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever.\\n   \"I can\\'t see what\\'s going to stop us tomorrow!\" said Wood. \"Not unless-Harry, you\\'ve sorted out your Dementor problem, haven\\'t you?\"\\n   \"Yeah... anything,\" said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a month. \"You know what-we should make up with Hermione... She was only trying to help...\"\\n   \"Yeah, reckon so,\" said Harry casually.\\n   \"Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! Potter\\'s really putting it through its paces now, see it turn-Chang\\'s Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt\\'s precision balance is really noticeable in these long-\"\\n   \"Jordan!\"\\n   \"Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!\" she said shrilly. \"First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything\\'s my fault, isn\\'t it! just leave me alone, Harry, I\\'ve got a lot of work to do!\"\\n   Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.\\n   \"D\\'you reckon we should tell someone?\" Harry asked Ron.\\n   \"Well done, Harry!\" said Percy, looking delighted. \"Ten Galleons to me! Must find Penelope, excuse me-\"\\n   \"Got plenty of special features, hasn\\'t it?\" said Malfoy, eyes glittering maliciously. \"Shame it doesn\\'t come with a parachute-in case you get too near a Dementor.\"\\n   Distracted, Harry looked down.\\n   Three Dementors, three tall, black, hooded Dementors, were looking up at him.\\n   He dived again, and Cho, thinking he\\'d seen the Snitch, tried to follow; Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time-the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.\\n   He didn\\'t stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, \"Expecto patronum!\"\\n   Something silver white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand. He knew it had shot directly at the Dementors but didn\\'t pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead-he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.\\n   Madam Hooch\\'s whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom. Down below he could hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd.\\n   \"The Dementors didn\\'t affect me at all!\" Harry said excitedly. \"I didn\\'t feel a thing!\"\\n   \"That\\'s my boy!\" Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his head would come off In complete disarray, the team managed to make its way back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the lead. Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.\\n   \"Yes, I knew him,\" he said shortly. \"Or I thought I did. You\\'d better be off, Harry, it\\'s getting late.\"\\n   Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay (\"Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity\" and at the rune translation Hermione was now poring over.\\n   \"How did you do that?\" squealed Angelina Johnson as George started throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd.\\n   \"Wood, Davies, shake hands,\" Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook hands with the Ravenclaw Captain.\\n   \"N-no,\" said Hermione in a trembling voice.\\n   Ron threw something down onto Hermione\\'s rune translation. Hermione and Harry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several long, ginger cat hairs.\\n  \\n   \\n    14. SNAPE\\'S GRUDGE\\n    13. GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW\\n   \\n   No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle was being searched again, and the whole House stayed awake in the common room, waiting to hear whether Black had been caught. Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped.\\n   Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely nervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs.\\n   Harry didn\\'t have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione\\'s impossible schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape\\'s essay. Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood.\\n   \"Because her cat acted like all cats do,\" Hagrid continued doggedly. \"She\\'s cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin\\' through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more\\'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she\\'s tryin\\' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak\\'s case, mind... She\\'s found some really good stuff fer me... reckon he\\'ll stand a good chance now...\"\\n  \\n  \\n   \\n    Hagrid\\n   \\n   It was better than he\\'d ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green and gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again.\\n   \"Harry, I\\'ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It\\'s Cho Chang. She\\'s a fourth year, and she\\'s pretty good... I really hoped she wouldn\\'t be fit, she\\'s had some problems with injuries...\" Wood scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, \"On the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt.\" He gave Harry\\'s broom a look of fervent admiration, then said, \"Okay, everyone, let\\'s go-\"\\n   At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms. The weather couldn\\'t have been more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn\\'t need it. He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.\\n   \"You said it\\'s harder if there are loads of them,\" said Harry.\\n   \"I see,\" said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. \"Well-let\\'s drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I\\'m supposed to take sides, as a teacher...\" he added hastily.\\n   They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he\\'d been wondering for a while.\\n   \"What-they kill-?\"\\n   \"Oh!\" screamed Cho, pointing.\\n   Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right behind him.\\n   \"Yeah, that\\'s true,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Hmmm... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us. You see, the Dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon.\"\\n   \"What\\'s the matter?\" said Ron.\\n   Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black.\\n   \"He had \\'em!\" said Sir Cadogan proudly. \"Had the whole week\\'s, my lady! Read \\'em off a little piece of paper!\"\\n   Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd. She was white as chalk.\\n   \"Who shouted?\"\\n   \"What\\'s all the noise?\"\\n   \"Put it here, Harry,\" he said, laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. People from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look. Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy\\'s Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt.\\n   \"N\\n   \\n   \"He sent me this,\" Hermione said, holding out the letter.\\n   Harry took it.

CAT, RAT, AND DOG\\n    1 o\\'clock, Ancient Runes\\n   \\n   \"Well, dear, I think we\\'ll leave it there... A little disappointing... but I\\'m sure you did your best.\"\\n   Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.\\n   \"If still had a willow-patterned shell, d\\'you think that\\'ll count against me?\"\\n   Then, after a hasty lunch, it was straight back upstairs for the Charms exam. Hermione had been right; Professor Flitwick did indeed test them on Cheering Charms. Harry slightly overdid his out of nerves and Ron, who was partnering him, ended up in fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led away to a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to perform the charm himself. After dinner, the students hurried back to their common rooms, not to relax, but to start studying for Care of Magical Creatures, Potions, and Astronomy.\\n   Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment.\\n   \"Wan\\' some tea?\" he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle.\\n   \"Why\\'d you stop me?\" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch. \"Did you see them? They\\'ve even got the axe ready! This isn\\'t justice!\"\\n   \"Ronald Weasley,\" said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.\\n   Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney\\'s words still resounding in his head. People were striding past him in the opposite direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of long awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the corner, however, sat Ron and Hermione.\\n   \"Ron!\" Harry hissed. \"Ron! Wake up!\"\\n   \"I can\\'t hold him-Scabbers, shut up, everyone\\'ll hear us-\"\\n   The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid\\'s garden. There was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe.\\n   Hermione\\'s breathing was shallow and uneven.\\n   \"Huh?\" I need you to tell me if you can see something!\"\\n   \"...if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I\\'m in serious trouble,\" he finished.\\n   \"The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that\\'s hardly something to joke about... Rise again, indeed-\"\\n   \"Captains, shake hands!\" said Madam Hooch.\\n   Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well until he reached the Hinkypunk, which successfully confused him into sinking waist high into the quagmire. Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the Boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming.\\n   \"Hermione, I don\\'t know what\\'s gotten into you lately!\" said Ron, astounded. \"First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney-\"\\n   Hermione looked up, startled.\\n   \"They\\'re comin\\'...\"\\n   Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.\\n   Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight-\\n   \"Oh, Ron, please let\\'s move, they\\'re going to do it!\" Hermione breathed.\\n   \"Okay-no wind to speak of-sun\\'s a bit bright, that could impair your vision, watch out for it-ground\\'s fairly hard, good, that\\'ll give us a fast kickoff-\"\\n   Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally, they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn.\\n   \"Lovely day,\" said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake. \"Pity... pity...\"\\n   He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch.\\n   \"Hagrid, we can\\'t-\"\\n   \"We\\'ve got to go,\" said Harry at once. \"He can\\'t just sit there on his own, waiting for the executioner!\"\\n   \"THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY HIS FOLLOWERS. HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. TONIGHT, BEFORE MIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS MASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANT\\'S AID, GREATER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE WAS. TONIGHT... BEFORE MIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT... WILL SET OUT... TO REJOIN... HIS MASTER...\"\\n   Professor Trelawney\\'s head fell forward onto her chest. She made a grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quite suddenly, Professor Trelawney\\'s head snapped up again.\\n   \"I\\'m telling it like it is, Professor!\"\\n   Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him, clubs raised-\\n   Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down. With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside, Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table.\\n   \"Scabbers, it\\'s me, you idiot, it\\'s Ron,\" Ron hissed.\\n   They heard a door open behind them and men\\'s voices.\\n   \"Oh, please, Ron,\" Hermione began.\\n   \"It\\'s from Hagrid,\" said Harry, ripping the note open. \"Buckbeak\\'s appeal-it\\'s set for the sixth.\"\\n   \"That\\'s true,\" said Hermione, getting to her feet. \"If he sees you... How do you open the witch\\'s hump again?\"\\n   A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.\\n   Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.\\n   \"Were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam?\"\\n   \"If we only had the Invisibility Cloak...\"\\n   \"Where\\'s Buckbeak, Hagrid?\" said Hermione hesitantly.\\n   \"IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT.\"\\n   Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he shot toward the Slytherins.\\n   \"And here are the Gryffindors!\" yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as commentator as usual. \"Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years-\"\\n   Lee\\'s comments were drowned by a tide of \"boos\" from the Slytherin end.\\n   \"And it\\'s Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinnet of Gryffindor with the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! Argh, no-Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington of Slytherin tearing up the field-WHAM!-nice Bludger work there by George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it\\'s caught by-Johnson, Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina-nice swerve around Montague-duck, Angelina, that\\'s a Bludger! SHE SCORES! TEN ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\"\\n   Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing into her.\\n   \"Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won\\'t happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession-\"\\n   it was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with his club and tried to say he\\'d thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the score forty ten to Gryffindor.\\n   The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead-\\n   Katie scored. Fifty ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred\\'s and George\\'s absence to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after the other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded.\\n   Madam Hooch was beside herself.\\n   \"Yeah, it does,\" said Harry slowly.\\n   \"They did it!\" she whispered to Harry. \"I d-don\\'t believe it-they did it!\"\\n  \\n   \\n    9 o\\'clock, Arithmancy\\n    Hagrid\\n   \\n   Harry\\'s mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the longshadowed grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.\\n   \"He\\'s tried,\" said Hagrid. \"He\\'s got no power ter overrule the Committee. He told \\'em Buckbeak\\'s all right, but they\\'re scared... Yeh know what Lucius Malfoy\\'s like... threatened \\'em, I expect... an\\' the executioner, Macnair, he\\'s an old pal o\\' Malfoy\\'s... but it\\'ll be quick an\\' clean... an\\' I\\'ll be beside him...\"\\n   Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks. He looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do. This helplessness was worse to watch than tears.\\n   \"We can\\'t,\" said Ron, who was paper white. \"He\\'ll be in worse trouble if they know we\\'ve been to see him...\"\\n   Hermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid\\'s cupboard for another milk jug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob. She straightened up with the new jug in her hands, fighting back tears.\\n   \"We\\'ll tell them what really happened-\"\\n   \"They can\\'t!\" Ron howled. \"I\\'ve spent ages reading up on stuff for him; they can\\'t just ignore it all!\"\\n   But Professor Trelawney didn\\'t seem to hear him. Her eyes started to roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to the hospital wing-and then Professor Trelawney spoke again, in the same harsh voice, quite unlike her own:\\n   \"THIRTY ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING-\"\\n   \"Locker rooms,\" said Wood tersely.\\n   None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he\\'d eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time at all, Wood was saying, \"Okay, it\\'s time, let\\'s go-\"\\n   They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. three-quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like \"GO GRYFFINDOR!\" and \"LIONS FOR THE CUP\" Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.\\n   \"And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He\\'s made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill-\"\\n   More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person in the Slytherin team; the rest of them were enormous.\\n   \"Come off it, Miss!\" howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle and Alicia flew forward to take the penalty.\\n   \"Come on,\" said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering.\\n   They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak. The light was fading fast now.\\n   Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry.\\n   \"Hermione!\" said Lupin, startled. \"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n   \"Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I\\'ve never seen such tactics.\" Madam Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his Nimbus Two Thousand and One.\\n   \"YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING AREA!\" she shrieked at Bole and Derrick. \"Gryffindor penalty!\"\\n   And just then, it emerged-a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it be an omen of Harry\\'s death?\\n   \"Ron, I don\\'t believe it-it\\'s Scabbers!\"\\n   Ron gaped at her.\\n   \"What does it resemble?\" whispered Professor Trelawney. \"Think, now...\" Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.\\n   \"AAAAAAARRRGH!\"\\n   They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina\\'s way was clear.\\n   \"Scabbers!\" said Ron blankly. \"Scabbers, what are you doing here?\"\\n   He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute\\'s frantic searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now... It wasn\\'t the Grim at all... it was a cat... Harry clutched the window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only Crookshanks...\\n   Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his nose flat against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too.\\n   And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him.\\n   Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking.\\n   \"Indeed!\" whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees. \"My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid\\'s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look closer... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?\"\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.\\n   \"Meet you in the common room,\" Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney\\'s voice called, \"Harry Potter!\"\\n   The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.\\n   \"Good luck, Harry!\" called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing.\\n   \"P-P-Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk. \"Sh-she said I\\'d failed everything!\"\\n   It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione\\'s Boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.\\n   Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren\\'t there. Where had they gone?\\n   A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater\\'s club at the back of Flint\\'s head. Flint\\'s nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed.\\n   \"That\\'s convenient,\" snorted Ron. \"You know, I\\'m starting to think Hermione was right about her\"-he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead-\"she\\'s a right old fraud.\"\\n   \"Yeh beat \\'em, Harry, yeh beat \\'em! Wait till I tell Buckbeak!\"\\n   There was Percy, jumping up and down like a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.\\n   It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, \"Team! Bed!\"\\n   Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked Malfoy\\'s arm out of the way and-\\n   \"YOU CHEATING SCUM!\" Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall\\'s reach. \"YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B-\"\\n   Professor McGonagall didn\\'t even bother to tell him off. She was actually shaking her finger in Malfoy\\'s direction, her hat had fallen off, and she too was shouting furiously.\\n   And Angelina scored. Sixty ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle Out of his hands; Alicia seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal-seventy ten.\\n   The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse-Gryffindor was sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoy speeding along behind him.\\n   And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face-there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer-Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead-\\n   \"Go!\" said Hagrid fiercely. \"It\\'s bad enough without you lot in trouble an\\' all!\"\\n   They had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron, they heard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight.\\n   \"Go! Go! Go!\" Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfoy-Harry flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him-he was at Malfoy\\'s ankles-he was level-\\n   Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed witch.\\n   \"A hippogriff,\" he said firmly.\\n   \"Is there any point asking how you\\'re going to sit for two exams at once?\" said Harry.\\n   \"Nope,\" said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak\\'s appeal started.\\n   The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, \"What did she ask? Was it okay?\"\\n   But they couldn\\'t. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George Weasley had been spotted working; they were about to take their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the highest qualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxious than Percy was Hermione.\\n   Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next day to enormous applause. Harry couldn\\'t help grinning broadly as he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual.\\n   Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching nothing himself. Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left the Great Hall, everyone applauded again.\\n   \"Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession-no! Gryffindor back in possession and it\\'s Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she\\'s streaking up the field-THAT WAS DELIBERATE!\"\\n   Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, and instead of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cart wheeled in the air, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle.\\n   Madam Hooch\\'s whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and began shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had put another penalty past the Slytherin Seeker.\\n   \"That will do!\" shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between then. \"Penalty shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!\"\\n   \"Come on, Alicia!\" yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd. \"YES! SHE\\'S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\"\\n   Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn\\'t reach-Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he\\'d wanted to do-the Snitch had disappeared again.\\n   \"Please, let\\'s hurry,\" Hermione whispered. \"I can\\'t stand it, I can\\'t bear it...\"\\n   They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was sinking fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple tinged grey, but to the west there was a ruby red glow.\\n   Ron stopped dead.\\n   \"Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,\" said Ron, but very quietly.\\n   Hermione swayed on the spot.\\n   \"They\\'re bringing the executioner to the appeal! But that sounds as though they\\'ve already decided!\"\\n   \"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking at his own watch. It was now two o\\'clock. \"Wish she\\'d hurry up...\"\\n   Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride.\\n   \"She says the crystal ball\\'s told her that if I tell you, I\\'ll have a horrible accident!\" squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing.\\n   \"That\\'s the day we finish our exams,\" said Hermione, still looking everywhere for her Arithmancy book.\\n   \"Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina, COME ON!\"\\n   Harry looked quickly back out of the window.\\n   Exam week began and an unnatural hush fell over the castle. The third years emerged from Transfiguration at lunchtime on Monday, limp and ashen-faced, comparing results and bemoaning the difficulty of the tasks they had been set, which had included turning a teapot into a tortoise. Hermione irritated the rest by fussing about how her tortoise had looked more like a turtle, which was the least of everyone else\\'s worries.\\n   \"Mount your brooms!\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three... two... one...\"\\n   The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch.\\n   \"And they\\'re coming up here to do it,\" said Harry, still reading from the letter. \"Someone from the Ministry of Magic and-and an executioner.\"\\n   Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment around on her table, looking for the book. Just then, there was a rustle at the window and Hedwig fluttered through it, a note clutched tight in her beak.\\n   \"It\\'s okay, Beaky,\" said Hagrid softly. \"It\\'s okay...\" He turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Go on,\" he said. \"Get goin\\'.\"\\n   By the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell around them.\\n   \"She hasn\\'t gone to get it?\" Ron said, staring after her.\\n   She had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes.\\n   \"Hermione?\" Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days. \"Er-are you sure you\\'ve copied down these times right?\"\\n   \"Where is it?\" said Hermione.\\n   Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely, fly forward to take the Slytherin penalty. Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched.\\n   \"\\'S\\'all dark, Harry,\" Ron muttered thickly. \"What\\'re you on about?\"\\n   \"Dumbledore\\'s gonna come down while it-while it happens. Wrote me this mornin\\'. Said he wants ter-ter be with me. Great man, Dumbledore...\"\\n   Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt\\'s tail, and was pulling it back.\\n   \"You-you just told me that the-the Dark Lord\\'s going to rise again... that his servant\\'s going to go back to him.\"\\n   Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled.\\n   \"Then you might not have to witness an execution at all!\" said Ron stoutly. \"The hippogriff might get off!\"\\n   But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him.\\n   \"Sunset, though,\" said Ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way. \"We\\'d never be allowed... \\'specially you, Harry...\"\\n   Harry sat there, staring at her.\\n   \"Isn\\'t there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?\" Harry asked fiercely, sitting down next to him. \"Dumbledore-\"\\n   \"Hello there, Harry!\" he said. \"Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly finished?\"\\n   \"You-\"\\n   Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other. Harry wasn\\'t going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch...\\n   \"Go quick,\" he said hoarsely. \"Don\\' listen...\" And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door.\\n   Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off silently around Hagrid\\'s house. As they reached the other side, the front door closed with a sharp snap.\\n   \"Professor Trelawney,\" Harry panted, \"just told me-\"\\n   But they all refused to say.\\n   \"She\\'s seeing us all separately,\" Neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. \"Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball?\" he asked them unhappily.\\n   \"OUCH!\"\\n   Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache. Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid\\'s cabin and said in a feeble voice, \"Dear, dear, I\\'m getting too old for this... Two o\\'clock, isn\\'t it, Fudge?\"\\n   The black mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall.\\n   \"YES!\"\\n   He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.\\n   \"I\\'m so sorry, dear boy,\" she said dreamily, \"the heat of the day, you know... I drifted off for a moment...\"\\n   Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn.\\n   Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts-but he mustn\\'t catch it yet-and if Malfoy saw it-\\n   Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron\\'s large feet reappeared on the ladder.\\n   \"How-could-they?\" she choked. \"How could they?\"\\n   \"Does that mean the appeal\\'s already happened?\" Ron interrupted, stepping forward.\\n   \"No,\" said Hermione shortly. \"Have either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Gramatica?\"\\n   \"Okay,\" she whispered, \"no one there-cloak on-\"\\n   Walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden Forest, gilding the top branches of the trees.\\n   They reached Hagrid\\'s cabin and knocked. He was a minute in answering, and when he did, he looked all around for his visitor, pale faced and trembling.\\n   \"Jordan, if you can\\'t commentate in an unbiased way-\"\\n   \"I-I took him outside,\" said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug. \"He\\'s tethered in me pumpkin patch. Thought he oughta see the trees an\\'-an\\' smell fresh air-before-\"\\n   Hagrid\\'s note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible.\\n   \\n   \"\\'Course, Wood\\'s a superb Keeper!\" Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint waited for Madam Hooch\\'s whistle. \"Superb! Very difficult to pass-very difficult indeed-YES! I DON\\'T BELIEVE IT! HE\\'S SAVED IT!\"\\n   Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still making sure he caught every word of Lee\\'s commentary. It was essential that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty points up-\\n   \"Ha haaa!\" yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other, clutching their heads. \"Too bad, boys! You\\'ll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt! And it\\'s Gryffindor in possession again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle-Flint alongside her-poke him in the eye, Angelina!-it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke-oh no-Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal posts, come on now, Wood, save-!\"\\n   But Harry could tell Hermione didn\\'t really believe what she was saying. All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn\\'t join in.\\n   Harry\\'s euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake.\\n   But they didn\\'t move.\\n   \"Hagrid,\" Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing, he made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms.\\n   \"We\\'ll stay with you too, Hagrid,\" she began, but Hagrid shook his shaggy head.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry firmly.\\n   \"Beaky\\'s gettin\\' a bit depressed,\" Hagrid told them, bending low on the pretense of checking that Harry\\'s flobberworm was still alive. \"Bin cooped up too long. But still... we\\'ll know day after tomorrow-one way or the other-\"\\n   They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try as Harry might, he couldn\\'t get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away.\\n   Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch hunts, while wishing he could have had one of Fortescue\\'s choco nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the greenhouses under a baking hot sun; then back to the common room once more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day, when it would all be over.\\n   Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a Grindylow, cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a Hinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new Boggart.\\n   \"Get out of it, Potter!\" Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found Harry blocking him.\\n   \"Are you sure?\" Professor Trelawney urged him. \"Are you quite sure, dear? You don\\'t see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?\"\\n   \"No, no, it\\'s scheduled for this afternoon,\" said Fudge, looking curiously at Ron.\\n   \"There\\'s another one in the cupboard,\" Hagrid said, sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back hopelessly.\\n   \"It\\'s Scabbers-he won\\'t-stay put-\"\\n   Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink his teeth into Ron\\'s hand.\\n   \"Scabbers, keep still,\" Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest. The rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force Scabbers deeper into his pocket. \"What\\'s the matter with you, you stupid rat? Stay still-OUCH! He bit me!\"\\n   \"Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can\\'t go saying things like that to his boss!\" said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. \"As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue his case properly, they can\\'t possibly execute Buckbeak...\"\\n   But Harry had a horrible feeling that the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures had had its mind made up by Mr. Malfoy. Draco, who had been noticeably subdued since Gryffindor\\'s triumph in the Quidditch final, seemed to regain some of his old swagger over the next few days. From sneering comments Harry overheard, Malfoy was certain Buckbeak was going to be killed, and seemed thoroughly pleased with himself for bringing it about. It was all Harry could do to stop himself imitating Hermione and hitting Malfoy in the face on these occasions. And the worst thing of all was that they had no time or opportunity to go and see Hagrid, because the strict new security measures had not been lifted, and Harry didn\\'t dare retrieve his Invisibility Cloak from below the one-eyed witch.\\n   Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Firebolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin end-it worked. Malfoy went haring after him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there...\\n   WHOOSH.\\n   One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry\\'s right ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again WHOOSH.\\n   The second Bludger grazed Harry\\'s elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was closing in.\\n   Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper-they were all going to block her-\\n   Harry\\'s and Ron\\'s last exam was Divination; Hermione\\'s, Muggle Studies. They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney\\'s classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last minute studying.\\n   \"Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal-Montague scores-\" Lee groaned. \"Seventy twenty to Gryffindor...\"\\n   Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging.\\n   \"SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty points to twenty!\"\\n   He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. Scabbers looked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron\\'s hands as though desperate to free himself.\\n   \"It\\'s us,\" Harry hissed. \"We\\'re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.\"\\n   \"Yeh\\'re ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don\\' wan\\' yeh watchin\\'. An\\' yeh shouldn\\' be down here anyway... If Fudge an\\' Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh\\'ll be in big trouble.\"\\n   Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione\\'s face, but she hid them from Hagrid, bustling around making tea. Then, as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek.\\n   \"Ron, be quiet!\" Hermione whispered urgently. \"Fudge\\'ll be out here in a minute-\"\\n  \\n  \\n   \\n    Lunch\\n    16. PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY\\'S PREDICTION\\n   \\n   Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking down the distant castle steps. In front was Albus Dumbledore, his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him trotted Cornelius Fudge. Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner, Macnair.\\n   \"Yeh shouldn\\'ve come!\" Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they stepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak.\\n   Hagrid\\'s hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor.\\n   \"I\\'m here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in.\"\\n   \"Down here-\"\\n   Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down-\\n   If only there had been a Dementor around... As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the world\\'s best Patronus.\\n  \\n   \\n    17. CAT, RAT, AND DOG\\n    1 o\\'clock, Ancient Runes\\n   \\n   \"Well, dear, I think we\\'ll leave it there... A little disappointing... but I\\'m sure you did your best.\"\\n   Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.\\n   \"If still had a willow-patterned shell, d\\'you think that\\'ll count against me?\"\\n   Then, after a hasty lunch, it was straight back upstairs for the Charms exam. Hermione had been right; Professor Flitwick did indeed test them on Cheering Charms. Harry slightly overdid his out of nerves and Ron, who was partnering him, ended up in fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led away to a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to perform the charm himself. After dinner, the students hurried back to their common rooms, not to relax, but to start studying for Care of Magical Creatures, Potions, and Astronomy.\\n   Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment.\\n   \"Wan\\' some tea?\" he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle.\\n   \"Why\\'d you stop me?\" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch. \"Did you see them? They\\'ve even got the axe ready! This isn\\'t justice!\"\\n   \"Ronald Weasley,\" said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.\\n   Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney\\'s words still resounding in his head. People were striding past him in the opposite direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of long awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the corner, however, sat Ron and Hermione.\\n   \"Ron!\" Harry hissed. \"Ron! Wake up!\"\\n   \"I can\\'t hold him-Scabbers, shut up, everyone\\'ll hear us-\"\\n   The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid\\'s garden. There was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe.\\n   Hermione\\'s breathing was shallow and uneven.\\n   \"Huh?\" I need you to tell me if you can see something!\"\\n   \"...if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I\\'m in serious trouble,\" he finished.\\n   \"The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that\\'s hardly something to joke about... Rise again, indeed-\"\\n   \"Captains, shake hands!\" said Madam Hooch.\\n   Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well until he reached the Hinkypunk, which successfully confused him into sinking waist high into the quagmire. Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the Boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming.\\n   \"Hermione, I don\\'t know what\\'s gotten into you lately!\" said Ron, astounded. \"First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney-\"\\n   Hermione looked up, startled.\\n   \"They\\'re comin\\'...\"\\n   Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.\\n   Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight-\\n   \"Oh, Ron, please let\\'s move, they\\'re going to do it!\" Hermione breathed.\\n   \"Okay-no wind to speak of-sun\\'s a bit bright, that could impair your vision, watch out for it-ground\\'s fairly hard, good, that\\'ll give us a fast kickoff-\"\\n   Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally, they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn.\\n   \"Lovely day,\" said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake. \"Pity... pity...\"\\n   He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch.\\n   \"Hagrid, we can\\'t-\"\\n   \"We\\'ve got to go,\" said Harry at once. \"He can\\'t just sit there on his own, waiting for the executioner!\"\\n   \"THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY HIS FOLLOWERS. HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. TONIGHT, BEFORE MIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS MASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANT\\'S AID, GREATER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE WAS. TONIGHT... BEFORE MIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT... WILL SET OUT... TO REJOIN... HIS MASTER...\"\\n   Professor Trelawney\\'s head fell forward onto her chest. She made a grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quite suddenly, Professor Trelawney\\'s head snapped up again.\\n   \"I\\'m telling it like it is, Professor!\"\\n   Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him, clubs raised-\\n   Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down. With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside, Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table.\\n   \"Scabbers, it\\'s me, you idiot, it\\'s Ron,\" Ron hissed.\\n   They heard a door open behind them and men\\'s voices.\\n   \"Oh, please, Ron,\" Hermione began.\\n   \"It\\'s from Hagrid,\" said Harry, ripping the note open. \"Buckbeak\\'s appeal-it\\'s set for the sixth.\"\\n   \"That\\'s true,\" said Hermione, getting to her feet. \"If he sees you... How do you open the witch\\'s hump again?\"\\n   A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.\\n   Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.\\n   \"Were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam?\"\\n   \"If we only had the Invisibility Cloak...\"\\n   \"Where\\'s Buckbeak, Hagrid?\" said Hermione hesitantly.\\n   \"IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT.\"\\n   Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he shot toward the Slytherins.\\n   \"And here are the Gryffindors!\" yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as commentator as usual. \"Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years-\"\\n   Lee\\'s comments were drowned by a tide of \"boos\" from the Slytherin end.\\n   \"And it\\'s Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinnet of Gryffindor with the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! Argh, no-Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington of Slytherin tearing up the field-WHAM!-nice Bludger work there by George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it\\'s caught by-Johnson, Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina-nice swerve around Montague-duck, Angelina, that\\'s a Bludger! SHE SCORES! TEN ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\"\\n   Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing into her.\\n   \"Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won\\'t happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten\\n   \\n    19. THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT\\n   \\n   It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking.\\n   \"You\\'re both mental.\"\\n   \"Ridiculous!\" said Hermione faintly.\\n   \"Peter Pettigrew\\'s dead!\" said Harry. \"He killed him twelve years ago!\"\\n   He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively.\\n   \"I meant to,\" he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \"but little Peter got the better of me... not this time, though!\"\\n   And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black\\'s weight fell on his broken leg.\\n   \"Sirius, NO!\" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again, \"WAIT! You can\\'t do it just like that-they need to understand-we\\'ve got to explain-\"\\n   \"We can explain afterwards!\" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron\\'s face and neck as he tried to escape.\\n   \"They\\'ve-got-a-right-to-know-everything!\" Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black. \"Ron\\'s kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don\\'t understand, and Harry-you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!\"\\n   Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron\\'s bitten, scratched, ad bleeding hands.\\n   \"All right... but you\\'ll need to help me, Sirius,\" said Lupin, \"I only know how it began...\"\\n   Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing.\\n   \"No one there...\"\\n   \"This place is haunted!\" said Ron.\\n   \"It\\'s not,\" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \"The Shrieking Shack was never haunted... The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\"\\n   He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment, then said, \"That\\'s where all of this starts-with my becoming a werewolf. None of this could have happened if I hadn\\'t been bitten... and if I hadn\\'t been so foolhardy...\"\\n   He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione said, \"Shh!\" She was watching Lupin very intently.\\n   \"I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform... I\\'m able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.\\n   \"Both,\" Hermione said quietly.\\n   Lupin forced a laugh.\\n   \"You\\'re the cleverest witch of your age I\\'ve ever met, Hermione.\"\\n   \"I\\'m not,\" Hermione whispered. \"If I\\'d been a bit cleverer, I\\'d have told everyone what you are!\"\\n   \"Come off it,\" he said weakly. \"Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean...\" He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support, \"Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat-there are millions of rats-how\\'s he supposed to know which one he\\'s after if he was locked up in Azkaban?\"\\n   \"You know, Sirius, that\\'s a fair question,\" said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly. \"How did you find out where he was?\"\\n   Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others.\\n   It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron\\'s shoulder, was Scabbers.\\n   \"How did you get this?\" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.\\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he\\'d received a huge electric shock.\\n   \"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin\\'s chest. \"Very useful, Potter, I thank you...\"\\n   Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. \"You\\'re wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\" he said, his eyes glittering. \"I\\'ve just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.\"\\n   \"Severus-\" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.\\n   \"I\\'ve told the headmaster again and again that you\\'re helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here\\'s the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout-\"\\n   \"Severus, you\\'re making a mistake,\" said Lupin urgently. \"You haven\\'t heard everything-I can explain-Sirius is not here to kill Harry-\"\\n   \"Two more for Azkaban tonight,\" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. \"I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this... He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin... a tame werewolf-\"\\n   \"You fool,\" said Lupin softly. \"Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?\"\\n   BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape\\'s wand and twisted themselves around Lupin\\'s mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black\\'s eyes.\\n   \"Going to kill me, Harry?\" he whispered.\\n   Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black\\'s chest, looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black\\'s left eye and his nose was bleeding.\\n   \"You killed my parents,\" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his wand hand quite steady.\\n   Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.\\n   \"I don\\'t deny it,\" he said very quietly. \"But if you knew the whole story.\"\\n   \"The whole story?\" Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. \"You sold them to Voldemort. That\\'s all I need to know.\"\\n   \"You\\'ve got to listen to me,\" Black said, and there was a note of urgency in his voice now. \"You\\'ll regret it if you don\\'t... You don\\'t understand...\"\\n   \"I understand a lot better than you think,\" said Harry, and his voice shook more than ever. \"You never heard her, did you? My mum... trying to stop Voldemort killing me... and you did that... you did it...\"\\n   Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black\\'s chest and settled himself there, right over Black\\'s heart. Black blinked and looked down at the cat.\\n   \"Get out of the way!\" he shouted at Ron and Hermione.\\n   They didn\\'t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron\\'s wands. Ron crawled to the four poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.\\n   Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at Black\\'s heart.\\n   \"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat-\"\\n   Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.\\n   \"Ron-come on back under the cloak-\" Hermione panted. \"Dumbledore and the Minister-they\\'ll be coming back out in a minute-\"\\n   But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws... Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow-an enormous, pale eyed, jet black dog.\\n   Harry reached for his wand, but too late-the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inchlong teeth-\\n   But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.\\n   Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry aside; the dog\\'s jaws fastened instead around Ron\\'s outstretched arm. Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute\\'s hair, but it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll-\\n   Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too.\\n   Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes.\\n   \"Lumos!\" he whispered.\\n   The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer.\\n   And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots-Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight-\\n   \"Ron!\" Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again.\\n   All they could see now was one of Ron\\'s legs, which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground-but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron\\'s leg had broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight.\\n   \"He won\\'t-stay-put-\"\\n   Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might, trying to break free of Ron\\'s grip.\\n   \"What\\'s the matter with him?\"\\n   But Harry had just seen-stinking toward them, his body low to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness-Crookshanks. Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers\\'s squeaks, Harry couldn\\'t tell.\\n   \"Crookshanks!\" Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped Harry\\'s arm painfully hard. \"How did he know-?\"\\n   \"He\\'s friends with that dog,\" said Harry grimly. \"I\\'ve seen them together. Come on-and keep your wand out-\"\\n   They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward, headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel. Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry\\'s wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside him.\\n   \"Where\\'s Ron?\" she whispered in a terrified voice.\\n   \"This way,\" said Harry, setting off, bent backed, after Crookshanks.\\n   \"Where does this tunnel come out?\" Hermione asked breathlessly from behind him.\\n   \"I don\\'t know... It\\'s marked on the Marauder\\'s Map but Fred and George said no one\\'s ever gotten into it... It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade...\"\\n   They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them, Crookshanks\\'s tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the passage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes... All Harry could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him... He was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a crouch...\\n   And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and Crookshanks had gone. Instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening.\\n   He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both raised their wands to see what lay beyond.\\n   It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all boarded up.\\n   Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded.\\n   Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry\\'s arm again. Her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows.\\n   \"Harry-we\\'re never going to get through without help-\"\\n   Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles.\\n   \"If that dog can get in, we can,\" Harry panted, darting here and there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn\\'t get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree\\'s blows.\\n   \"Oh, help, help,\" Hermione whispered frantically, dancing uncertainly on the spot, \"Please...\"\\n   Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk.\\n   Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.\\n   \"DON\\'T BELIEVE IT!\" Hermione screamed.\\n   Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild eyed.\\n   \"You-you-\"\\n   \"Hermione-\"\\n   \"A thought that still haunts me,\" said Lupin heavily. \"And there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young, thoughtless-carried away with our own cleverness.\\n   \"I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore\\'s trust, of course... he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others\\' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month\\'s adventure. And I haven\\'t changed...\"\\n   Lupin\\'s face had hardened, and there was self disgust in his voice. \"All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn\\'t do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I\\'d betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I\\'d led others along with me... and Dumbledore\\'s trust has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape\\'s been right about me all along.\"\\n   \"Snape?\" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers; for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. \"What\\'s Snape got to do with it?\"\\n   \"He\\'s here, Sirius,\" said Lupin heavily. \"He\\'s teaching here as well.\" He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\\n   \"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling Dumbledore a year that I am not to be trusted. He has his reasons... you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me-\"\\n   Black made a derisive noise.\\n   \"It served him right,\" he sneered. \"Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled...\"\\n   \"Severus was very interested in where I went every month.\" Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"We were in the same year, you know, and we-er-didn\\'t like each other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James\\'s talent on the Quidditch field... anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be-er-amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he\\'d be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it-if he\\'d got as far as this house, he\\'d have met a fully grown werewolf-but your father, who\\'d heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life... Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was...\"\\n   \"So that\\'s why Snape doesn\\'t like you,\" said Harry slowly, \"because he thought you were in on the joke?\"\\n   \"That\\'s right,\" sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin.\\n   Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing, directly at Lupin.\\n  \\n   \\n   \"-you and him!\"\\n   \"Hermione, calm down-\"\\n   \"I didn\\'t tell anyone!\" Hermione shrieked. \"I\\'ve been covering up for you-\"\\n   \"Hermione, listen to me, please!\" Lupin shouted. \"I can explain-\"\\n   Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave of fury.\\n   \"I trusted you,\" he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering, out of control, \"and all the time you\\'ve been his friend!\"\\n   \"You\\'re wrong,\" said Lupin. \"I haven\\'t been Sirius\\'s friend, but I am now-Let me explain...\"\\n   \"NO!\" Hermione screamed. \"Harry, don\\'t trust him, he\\'s been helping Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too-he\\'s a werewolf!\"\\n   There was a ringing silence. Everyone\\'s eyes were now on Lupin, who looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.\\n   \"Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,\" he said. \"Only one out of three, I\\'m afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly don\\'t want Harry dead.\" An odd shiver passed over his face. \"But I won\\'t deny that I am a werewolf.\"\\n   Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, \"Get away ftom me, werewolf!\"\\n   Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione and said, \"How long have you known?\"\\n   \"All right, then,\" Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat.\\n   \"Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for...\"\\n   \"You\\'re nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support. \"I\\'ve had enough of this. I\\'m off.\"\\n   He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers.\\n   \"You\\'re going to hear me out, Ron,\" he said quietly. \"Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.\"\\n   \"Harry!\" Hermione whimpered. \"Be quiet!\"\\n   \"HE\\'S NOT PETER, HE\\'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.\\n   \"There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\" he said. \"A whole street full of them...\"\\n   \"They didn\\'t see what they thought they saw!\" said Black savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron\\'s hands.\\n   \"Everything,\" said Lupin. \"Could I see him, please?\"\\n   Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black\\'s leg and made a soft hissing noise.\\n   Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers.\\n   \"What?\" Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared. \"What\\'s my rat got to do with anything?\"\\n   \"That\\'s not a rat,\" croaked Sirius Black suddenly.\\n   \"What d\\'you mean-of course he\\'s a rat-\"\\n   \"No, he\\'s not,\" said Lupin quietly. \"He\\'s a wizard.\"\\n   \"And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius Black... I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow-\"\\n   \"One of us!\" Ron said angrily.\\n   \"No, Ron,\" said Lupin. \"Two of you.\"\\n   He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.\\n   \"Don\\'t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf\\'s mind works,\" hissed Snape. \"Get out of the way, Potter.\"\\n   \"YOU\\'RE PATHETIC!\" Harry yelled. \"JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON\\'T EVEN LISTEN-\"\\n   \"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!\" Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. \"Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he\\'d killed you! You\\'d have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black-now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!\"\\n   Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step toward him, he had raised his wand.\\n   \"Get away from him-get away-Scabbers, come here-\"\\n   There was a loud thud.\\n   \"HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!\" Harry roared, and with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione\\'s and Ron\\'s restraint and lunged forward-\\n   He had forgotten about magic-he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full grown man-all Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and that he didn\\'t care how much he got hurt in return-\\n   Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black didn\\'t raise the wands in time-one of Harry\\'s hands fastened over his wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry\\'s other hand collided with the side of Black\\'s head and they fell, backward, into the wall-\\n   Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black\\'s hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry\\'s face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of Black it could find.\\n   But Black\\'s free hand had found Harry\\'s throat.\\n   \"No,\" he hissed, \"I\\'ve waited too long-\"\\n   The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.\\n   Then he saw Hermione\\'s foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black\\'s wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter-\\n   He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward it but-\\n   \"Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework-the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there\\'s a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew\\'s name wasn\\'t on the list.\"\\n   Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.\\n   \"Light again, Hermione!\" he said. \"But the Ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\"\\n   \"I you\\'re going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\" said Black, who was still watching Scabbers\\'s every desperate move. \"I\\'ve waited twelve years, I\\'m not going to wait much longer.\"\\n   \"An Animagus,\" said Black, \"by the name of Peter Pettigrew.\"\\n  \\n   \\n    19. THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT\\n   \\n   It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking.\\n   \"You\\'re both mental.\"\\n   \"Ridiculous!\" said Hermione faintly.\\n   \"Peter Pettigrew\\'s dead!\" said Harry. \"He killed him twelve years ago!\"\\n   He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively.\\n   \"I meant to,\" he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \"but little Peter got the better of me... not this time, though!\"\\n   And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black\\'s weight fell on his broken leg.\\n   \"Sirius, NO!\" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again, \"WAIT! You can\\'t do it just like that-they need to understand-we\\'ve got to explain-\"\\n   \"We can explain afterwards!\" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron\\'s face and neck as he tried to escape.\\n   \"They\\'ve-got-a-right-to-know-everything!\" Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black. \"Ron\\'s kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don\\'t understand, and Harry-you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!\"\\n   Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron\\'s bitten, scratched, ad bleeding hands.\\n   \"All right... but you\\'ll need to help me, Sirius,\" said Lupin, \"I only know how it began...\"\\n   Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing.\\n   \"No one there...\"\\n   \"This place is haunted!\" said Ron.\\n   \"It\\'s not,\" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \"The Shrieking Shack was never haunted... The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\"\\n   He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment, then said, \"That\\'s where all of this starts-with my becoming a werewolf. None of this could have happened if I hadn\\'t been bitten... and if I hadn\\'t been so foolhardy...\"\\n   He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione said, \"Shh!\" She was watching Lupin very intently.\\n   \"I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform... I\\'m able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.\\n   \"Both,\" Hermione said quietly.\\n   Lupin forced a laugh.\\n   \"You\\'re the cleverest witch of your age I\\'ve ever met, Hermione.\"\\n   \"I\\'m not,\" Hermione whispered. \"If I\\'d been a bit cleverer, I\\'d have told everyone what you are!\"\\n   \"Come off it,\" he said weakly. \"Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean...\" He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support, \"Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat-there are millions of rats-how\\'s he supposed to know which one he\\'s after if he was locked up in Azkaban?\"\\n   \"You know, Sirius, that\\'s a fair question,\" said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly. \"How did you find out where he was?\"\\n   Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others.\\n   It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron\\'s shoulder, was Scabbers.\\n   \"How did you get this?\" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.\\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he\\'d received a huge electric shock.\\n   \"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin\\'s chest. \"Very useful, Potter, I thank you...\"\\n   Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. \"You\\'re wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\" he said, his eyes glittering. \"I\\'ve just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.\"\\n   \"Severus-\" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.\\n   \"I\\'ve told the headmaster again and again that you\\'re helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here\\'s the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout-\"\\n   \"Severus, you\\'re making a mistake,\" said Lupin urgently. \"You haven\\'t heard everything-I can explain-Sirius is not here to kill Harry-\"\\n   \"Two more for Azkaban tonight,\" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. \"I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this... He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin... a tame werewolf-\"\\n   \"You fool,\" said Lupin softly. \"Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?\"\\n   BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape\\'s wand and twisted themselves around Lupin\\'s mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black\\'s eyes.\\n   \"Going to kill me, Harry?\" he whispered.\\n   Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black\\'s chest, looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black\\'s left eye and his nose was bleeding.\\n   \"You killed my parents,\" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his wand hand quite steady.\\n   Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.\\n   \"I don\\'t deny it,\" he said very quietly. \"But if you knew the whole story.\"\\n   \"The whole story?\" Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. \"You sold them to Voldemort. That\\'s all I need to know.\"\\n   \"You\\'ve got to listen to me,\" Black said, and there was a note of urgency in his voice now. \"You\\'ll regret it if you don\\'t... You don\\'t understand...\"\\n   \"I understand a lot better than you think,\" said Harry, and his voice shook more than ever. \"You never heard her, did you? My mum... trying to stop Voldemort killing me... and you did that... you did it...\"\\n   Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black\\'s chest and settled himself there, right over Black\\'s heart. Black blinked and looked down at the cat.\\n   \"Get out of the way!\" he shouted at Ron and Hermione.\\n   They didn\\'t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron\\'s wands. Ron crawled to the four poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.\\n   Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at Black\\'s heart.\\n   \"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat-\"\\n   Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.\\n   \"Ron-come on back under the cloak-\" Hermione panted. \"Dumbledore and the Minister-they\\'ll be coming back out in a minute-\"\\n   But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws... Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow-an enormous, pale eyed, jet black dog.\\n   Harry reached for his wand, but too late-the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inchlong teeth-\\n   But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.\\n   Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry aside; the dog\\'s jaws fastened instead around Ron\\'s outstretched arm. Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute\\'s hair, but it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll-\\n   Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too.\\n   Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes.\\n   \"Lumos!\" he whispered.\\n   The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer.\\n   And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots-Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight-\\n   \"Ron!\" Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again.\\n   All they could see now was one of Ron\\'s legs, which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground-but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron\\'s leg had broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight.\\n   \"He won\\'t-stay-put-\"\\n   Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might, trying to break free of Ron\\'s grip.\\n   \"What\\'s the matter with him?\"\\n   But Harry had just seen-stinking toward them, his body low to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness-Crookshanks. Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers\\'s squeaks, Harry couldn\\'t tell.\\n   \"Crookshanks!\" Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped Harry\\'s arm painfully hard. \"How did he know-?\"\\n   \"He\\'s friends with that dog,\" said Harry grimly. \"I\\'ve seen them together. Come on-and keep your wand out-\"\\n   They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward, headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel. Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry\\'s wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside him.\\n   \"Where\\'s Ron?\" she whispered in a terrified voice.\\n   \"This way,\" said Harry, setting off, bent backed, after Crookshanks.\\n   \"Where does this tunnel come out?\" Hermione asked breathlessly from behind him.\\n   \"I don\\'t know... It\\'s marked on the Marauder\\'s Map but Fred and George said no one\\'s ever gotten into it... It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade...\"\\n   They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them, Crookshanks\\'s tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the passage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes... All Harry could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him... He was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a crouch...\\n   And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and Crookshanks had gone. Instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening.\\n   He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both raised their wands to see what lay beyond.\\n   It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all boarded up.\\n   Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded.\\n   Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry\\'s arm again. Her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows.\\n   \"Harry-we\\'re never going to get through without help-\"\\n   Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles.\\n   \"If that dog can get in, we can,\" Harry panted, darting here and there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn\\'t get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree\\'s blows.\\n   \"Oh, help, help,\" Hermione whispered frantically, dancing uncertainly on the spot, \"Please...\"\\n   Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk.\\n   Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.\\n   \"DON\\'T BELIEVE IT!\" Hermione screamed.\\n   Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild eyed.\\n   \"You-you-\"\\n   \"Hermione-\"\\n   \"A thought that still haunts me,\" said Lupin heavily. \"And there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young, thoughtless-carried away with our own cleverness.\\n   \"I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore\\'s trust, of course... he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others\\' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month\\'s adventure. And I haven\\'t changed...\"\\n   Lupin\\'s face had hardened, and there was self disgust in his voice. \"All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn\\'t do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I\\'d betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I\\'d led others along with me... and Dumbledore\\'s trust has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape\\'s been right about me all along.\"\\n   \"Snape?\" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers; for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. \"What\\'s Snape got to do with it?\"\\n   \"He\\'s here, Sirius,\" said Lupin heavily. \"He\\'s teaching here as well.\" He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\\n   \"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling Dumbledore a year that I am not to be trusted. He has his reasons... you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me-\"\\n   Black made a derisive noise.\\n   \"It served him right,\" he sneered. \"Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled...\"\\n   \"Severus was very interested in where I went every month.\" Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"We were in the same year, you know, and we-er-didn\\'t like each other very much.

Sirius thought it would be-er-amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he\\'d be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it-if he\\'d got as far as this house, he\\'d have met a fully grown werewolf-but your father, who\\'d heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life...

Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, \"Get away ftom me, werewolf!\"\\n   Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione and said, \"How long have you known?\"\\n   \"All right, then,\" Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat.\\n   \"Tell them whatever you like.

I\\'m off.\"\\n   He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers.\\n   \"You\\'re going to hear me out, Ron,\" he said quietly. \"Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.\"\\n   \"Harry!\" Hermione whimpered. \"Be quiet!\"\\n   \"HE\\'S NOT PETER, HE\\'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed.

I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of me alarmed you.\\n    I believe the Dementors are still searching for me, but they haven\\'t a hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle will be lifted.\\n   \"-doesn\\'t sound like there\\'s anything we can do-\"\\n   \"I don\\'t want a connection with Pettigrew!\" said Harry. \"He betrayed my parents!\"\\n   \"This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents... They will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you... That must never happen again.\"\\n   \"You\\'re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we\\'ve ever had!\" said Harry. \"Don\\'t go!\"\\n   Lupin shook his head and didn\\'t speak. He carried on emptying his drawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay, Lupin said, \"From what the headmaster told me this morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. If I\\'m proud of anything I\\'ve done this year, it\\'s how much you\\'ve learned... Tell me about your Patronus.\"\\n   \"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\\n   \"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \\'You-Know-Who\\' nonsense-for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.\"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying \\'You-Know-Who.\\' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\\'s name.\"\\n   \"I know,\" sighed Hermione, \"but I can\\'t stand another year like this one. That Time-Turner, it was driving me mad. I\\'ve handed it in. Without Muggle Studies and Divination, I\\'ll be able to have a normal schedule again.\"\\n   \"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\\n   \"What\\'s his name again? Howard, isn\\'t it?\"\\n   \"He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the room with him. When this gets out-\"\\n   \"Ha!\" said Hermione triumphantly. \"See! I told you it was from him!\"\\n   \"Yes, but he hadn\\'t jinxed it, had he?\" said Ron. \"Ouch!\"\\n   The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way.\\n   \\n    I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.\\n    Sirius\\n   \\n   Ron\\'s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. \"Keep him?\" he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a moment; then, to Harry\\'s and Hermione\\'s great surprise, he held him out for Crookshanks to sniff.\\n   \"What do you reckon?\" Ron asked the cat. \"Definitely an owl?\"\\n   Crookshanks purred.\\n   \"That\\'s wonderful!\" said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing.\\n   \"Yeah... can\\'t\\'ve tied him up properly,\" said Hagrid, gazing happily out over the grounds. \"I was worried this mornin\\', mind... thought he mighta met Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he never ate anythin\\' las\\' night...\"\\n   \"What?\" said Harry quickly.\\n   \"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I\\'ve got him, sir.\"\\n   \"No, sir-house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\\' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\\' over Bristol.\"\\n   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\\n   \"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\\n   \"Beaky! He escaped! He\\'s free! Bin celebratin\\' all night!\"\\n   \"The Potters, that\\'s right, that\\'s what I heard-\"\\n   \"A lemon drop. They\\'re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\'m rather fond of.\"\\n   \"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\\n   \"Godfather?\" sputtered Uncle Vernon. \"You haven\\'t got a godfather!\"\\n   \"Yes, I have,\" said Harry brightly. \"He was my mum and dad\\'s best friend. He\\'s a convicted murderer, but he\\'s broken out of wizard prison and he\\'s on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep up with my news... check if I\\'m happy...\"\\n   And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon\\'s face, Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked like a much better summer than the last.\\n   \\n    Dear Harry,\\n    I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it\\'s my fault he no longer has a rat.\\n    Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won\\'t tell you where, in case this owl falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his reliability, but he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.\\n    I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don\\'t know whether they\\'re used to owl post.\\n    Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays\\' worth of presents from your godfather.\\n    I\\'ll write again soon.\\n    There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt-\\n   \\n   \"That\\'s good enough for me,\" said Ron happily. \"He\\'s mine.\"\\n   Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King\\'s Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and three-quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a good distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed.\\n   \"I\\'m afraid it is,\" said Lupin. He started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents.\\n   \"Why?\" said Harry. \"The Ministry of Magic don\\'t think you were helping Sirius, do they?\"\\n   Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.\\n   \"OUT WITH IT, POTTER!\" he bellowed. \"WHAT DID YOU DO?\"\\n   \"Really-they\\'ll wake everybody up! What do they think they\\'re doing?\"\\n   Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing nearer-\\n   \"He\\'s not the only one!\" puffed Fudge. \"The Daily Prophet\\'s going to have a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff\\'s escape to get out, and I\\'ll be a laughingstock! Well... I\\'d better go and notify the Ministry...\"\\n   \"Awhat?\"\\n   \"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\\'ll be famous-a legend-I wouldn\\'t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in thefuture-there will be books written about Harry-every child in our world will know his name!\"\\n   \"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\\n   He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\\n   \"I don\\'t care. I still want to see him. I\\'ll meet you back here.\"\\n   Lupin\\'s office door was open. He had already packed most of his things. The Grindylow\\'s empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase, which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door.\\n   \"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\\n   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\\n   \"HE DIDN\\'T DISAPPARATE!\" Snape roared, now very close at hand. \"YOU CAN\\'T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS-HAS-SOMETHING-TO-DO-WITH-POTTER!\"\\n   \"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you\\'ll wake the Muggles!\"\\n   \"See here, Snape, be reasonable,\" said Fudge. \"This door\\'s been locked, we just saw-\"\\n   \"Thank you, Headmaster.\"\\n   Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty Grindylow tank.\\n   \"Well-good bye, Harry,\" he said, smiling. \"It has been a real pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we\\'ll meet again sometime. Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage...\"\\n   Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible.\\n   \"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\\n   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\' time by Mrs. Dursley\\'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn\\'t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up theirglasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter-the boy who lived!\"\\n   2. THE VANISHING GLASS\\n   Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\\' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets-but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by hismother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\\n   Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\\n   \"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"\\n   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,\"Hagrid\\'s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\\'d be here, by the way?\"\\n   \"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to tell mewhy you\\'re here, of all places?\"\\n   \"If I manage to get into the Ministry, I\\'ll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement!\" he told the only person who would listen-his girlfriend, Penelope.\\n   Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so cheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits.\\n   He certainly wasn\\'t the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin go. The whole of Harry\\'s Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his resignation.\\n   \"Wonder what they\\'ll give us next year?\" said Seamus Finnigan gloomily.\\n   \"My dear Professor, I\\'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\\n   \"You\\'d be stiff if you\\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\n   \"An easy mistake to make,\" said Dumbledore softly. \"I expect you\\'ll tire of hearing it, but you do look extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes... you have your mother\\'s eyes.\\n   Harry shook his head.\\n   \"It\\'s lucky it\\'s dark. I haven\\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\"\\n   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said,\"The owls are nothing next to therumors that are flying around. You know what everyone\\'s saying? About why he\\'s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\"\\n   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever\"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\\n   \"What they\\'resaying,\" she pressed on,\"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\\'s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are-are-that they\\'re-dead.\"\\n   Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\\n   \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\\'s drive.\\n   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar-a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\\'t realize what he had seen-then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\\'t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive-no,looking at the sign; cats couldn\\'t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\n   But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\\'t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\\'t bear people who dressed in funny clothes-the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\\'t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt-these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\\n   Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\\'t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.He didn\\'t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\\'d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\\n   He\\'d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\\'s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\\'t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\\'t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\\n   \"This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew\\'s life.\"\\n   Harry couldn\\'t imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking.\\n   \"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\\'s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"\\n   She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\\'t, so she went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he reallyhas gone, Dumbledore?\"\\n   \"It didn\\'t make any difference,\" said Harry bitterly. \"Pettigrew got away.\"\\n   \"Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been.\" he said thoughtfully. \"Who\\'d have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise...\"\\n   \"Calm down, man!\" Fudge barked. \"You\\'re talking nonsense!\"\\n   \"YOU DON\\'T KNOW POTTER!\" shrieked Snape. \"HE DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT-\"\\n   \"That\\'ll be good enough for Dumbledore!\" said Harry happily. He looked back at Sirius\\'s letter. \"Hang on, there\\'s a PS...\"\\n   \\n    If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.\\n    I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter\\'s godfather, hereby give him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends.\\n   \\n   Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though he\\'d swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp.\\n   \\n   \"Hagrid would like that,\" said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry and Hermione. As he and Fudge left the dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she headed back to her office.\\n   There was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had woken up. They could see him sitting up, rubbing his head, looking around.\\n   \"What-what happened?\" he groaned. \"Harry? Why are we in here? Where\\'s Sirius? Where\\'s Lupin? What\\'s going on?\" Harry and Hermione looked at each other.\\n   \"You explain,\" said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate.\\n   * * *\\n   When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The sweltering, heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going, however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank. The stag had galloped toward him from there just last night...\\n   A shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very bleary eyed Hagrid, mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them.\\n   \"Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"An extraordinary achievement-not least, keeping it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father last night... You found him inside yourself.\"\\n   And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused thoughts.\\n   * * *\\n   Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached, Harry heard many different theories about what had really happened, but none of them came close to the truth.\\n   Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius\\'s escape.\\n   \"Indeed?\" said Dumbledore. \"Er-stranger than usual, you mean?\"\\n   \"Yes... her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said... she said Voldemort\\'s servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight... She said the servant would help him come back to power.\" Harry stared up at Dumbledore. \"And then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn\\'t remember anything she\\'d said. Was it-was she making a real prediction?\"\\n   Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.\\n   \"Even if I could, I wouldn\\'t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well-give him here, Hagrid-we\\'d better get this over with.\"\\n   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\\' house.\\n   \"Couldn\\'t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"\\n   \"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy\\'s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\'t even remember! Can\\'t you see how much better off he\\'ll be, growing up away from all that until he\\'s ready to take it?\"\\n   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said,\"Yes-yes, you\\'re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\\n   \"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\"\\n   \"But if he helps Voldemort back to power-\"\\n   \"Professor Dumbledore-yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very-very strange.\"\\n   \"Is that where-?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He\\'ll have that scar forever.\"\\n   \"Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my patients now?\"\\n   She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves jangling... And then, as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them...\\n   \"What was that?\" said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.\\n   Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door.\\n   \"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can\\'t stand it-Lily an\\' James dead-an\\' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles-\"\\n   \"Yes, yes, it\\'s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\\'ll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\\'s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\\'s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\\'s eyes seemedto have gone out.\\n   \"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that\\'s that. We\\'ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"\\n   \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I\\'ll be takin\\' Sirius his bike back. G\\'night, Professor McGonagall-Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"\\n   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\\n   \"I still can\\'t believe you didn\\'t tell us about it,\" said Ron grumpily. \"We\\'re supposed to be your friends.\"\\n   \"I saw you coming,\" said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to the parchment he had been poring over. It was the Marauder\\'s Map.\\n   \"I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,\" he said gently. \"He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.\"\\n   Harry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn\\'t laugh-he could tell Dumbledore...\\n   \"I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast. I\\'ve decided to drop Muggle Studies.\"\\n   \"But-\" Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so calmly? \"But-I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew! That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!\"\\n   \"It was stupid, thinking it was him,\" he muttered. \"I mean, I knew he was dead.\"\\n   \"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don\\'t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night.\"\\n   It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumblefore had said.\\n   \"Leavin\\', isn\\' he?\" said Hagrid, looking surprised that Harry had to ask. \"Resigned firs\\' thing this mornin\\'. Says he can\\'t risk it happenin again.\"\\n   Harry scrambled to his feet.\\n   \"I\\'m not saying his heart isn\\'t in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can\\'t pretend he\\'s not careless. He does tend to-what was that?\"\\n   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky-and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\\n   If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and sowild-long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\\n   \"Harry,\" said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder. \"What\\'s that thing outside your window?\"\\n   Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way and that in the train\\'s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the window, stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it carefully inside.\\n   The owl dropped its letter onto Harry\\'s seat and began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm\\'s way.\\n   Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the letter, and shouted, \"It\\'s from Sirius!\"\\n   \"What?\" said Ron and Hermione excitedly. \"Read it aloud!\"\\n   \\n    I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that night last year when you left your uncle\\'s house. I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of me alarmed you.\\n    I believe the Dementors are still searching for me, but they haven\\'t a hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle will be lifted.\\n   \"-doesn\\'t sound like there\\'s anything we can do-\"\\n   \"I don\\'t want a connection with Pettigrew!\" said Harry. \"He betrayed my parents!\"\\n   \"This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents... They will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you... That must never happen again.\"\\n   \"You\\'re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we\\'ve ever had!\" said Harry. \"Don\\'t go!\"\\n   Lupin shook his head and didn\\'t speak. He carried on emptying his drawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay, Lupin said, \"From what the headmaster told me this morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. If I\\'m proud of anything I\\'ve done this year, it\\'s how much you\\'ve learned... Tell me about your Patronus.\"\\n   \"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\\n   \"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \\'You-Know-Who\\' nonsense-for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.\"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying \\'You-Know-Who.\\' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\\'s name.\"\\n   \"I know,\" sighed Hermione, \"but I can\\'t stand another year like this one. That Time-Turner, it was driving me mad. I\\'ve handed it in. Without Muggle Studies and Divination, I\\'ll be able to have a normal schedule again.\"\\n   \"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\\n   \"What\\'s his name again? Howard, isn\\'t it?\"\\n   \"He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the room with him. When this gets out-\"\\n   \"Ha!\" said Hermione triumphantly. \"See! I told you it was from him!\"\\n   \"Yes, but he hadn\\'t jinxed it, had he?\" said Ron. \"Ouch!\"\\n   The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way.\\n   \\n    I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.\\n    Sirius\\n   \\n   Ron\\'s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. \"Keep him?\" he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a moment; then, to Harry\\'s and Hermione\\'s great surprise, he held him out for Crookshanks to sniff.\\n   \"What do you reckon?\" Ron asked the cat. \"Definitely an owl?\"\\n   Crookshanks purred.\\n   \"That\\'s wonderful!\" said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing.\\n   \"Yeah... can\\'t\\'ve tied him up properly,\" said Hagrid, gazing happily out over the grounds. \"I was worried this mornin\\', mind... thought he mighta met Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he never ate anythin\\' las\\' night...\"\\n   \"What?\" said Harry quickly.\\n   \"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I\\'ve got him, sir.\"\\n   \"No, sir-house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\\' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\\' over Bristol.\"\\n   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\\n   \"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\\n   \"Beaky! He escaped! He\\'s free! Bin celebratin\\' all night!\"\\n   \"The Potters, that\\'s right, that\\'s what I heard-\"\\n   \"A lemon drop. They\\'re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\'m rather fond of.\"\\n   \"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\\n   \"Godfather?\" sputtered Uncle Vernon. \"You haven\\'t got a godfather!\"\\n   \"Yes, I have,\" said Harry brightly. \"He was my mum and dad\\'s best friend. He\\'s a convicted murderer, but he\\'s broken out of wizard prison and he\\'s on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep up with my news... check if I\\'m happy...\"\\n   And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon\\'s face, Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked like a much better summer than the last.\\n   \\n    Dear Harry,\\n    I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it\\'s my fault he no longer has a rat.\\n    Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won\\'t tell you where, in case this owl falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his reliability, but he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.\\n    I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don\\'t know whether they\\'re used to owl post.\\n    Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays\\' worth of presents from your godfather.\\n    I\\'ll write again soon.\\n    There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt-\\n   \\n   \"That\\'s good enough for me,\" said Ron happily. \"He\\'s mine.\"\\n   Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King\\'s Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and three-quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a good distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed.\\n   \"I\\'m afraid it is,\" said Lupin. He started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents.\\n   \"Why?\" said Harry. \"The Ministry of Magic don\\'t think you were helping Sirius, do they?\"\\n   Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.\\n   \"OUT WITH IT, POTTER!\" he bellowed. \"WHAT DID YOU DO?\"\\n   \"Really-they\\'ll wake everybody up! What do they think they\\'re doing?\"\\n   Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing nearer-\\n   \"He\\'s not the only one!\" puffed Fudge. \"The Daily Prophet\\'s going to have a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff\\'s escape to get out, and I\\'ll be a laughingstock! Well... I\\'d better go and notify the Ministry...\"\\n   \"Awhat?\"\\n   \"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\\'ll be famous-a legend-I wouldn\\'t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in thefuture-there will be books written about Harry-every child in our world will know his name!\"\\n   \"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\\n   He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\\n   \"I don\\'t care. I still want to see him. I\\'ll meet you back here.\"\\n   Lupin\\'s office door was open. He had already packed most of his things. The Grindylow\\'s empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase, which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door.\\n   \"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\\n   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\\n   \"HE DIDN\\'T DISAPPARATE!\" Snape roared, now very close at hand. \"YOU CAN\\'T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS-HAS-SOMETHING-TO-DO-WITH-POTTER!\"\\n   \"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you\\'ll wake the Muggles!\"\\n   \"See here, Snape, be reasonable,\" said Fudge. \"This door\\'s been locked, we just saw-\"\\n   \"Thank you, Headmaster.\"\\n   Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty Grindylow tank.\\n   \"Well-good bye, Harry,\" he said, smiling. \"It has been a real pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we\\'ll meet again sometime. Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage...\"\\n   Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible.\\n   \"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\\n   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\' time by Mrs. Dursley\\'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn\\'t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up theirglasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter-the boy who lived!\"\\n   2. THE VANISHING GLASS\\n   Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\\' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets-but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by hismother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\\n   Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\\n   \"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"\\n   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,\"Hagrid\\'s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\\'d be here, by the way?\"\\n   \"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to tell mewhy you\\'re here, of all places?\"\\n   \"If I manage to get into the Ministry, I\\'ll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement!\" he told the only person who would listen-his girlfriend, Penelope.\\n   Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so cheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits.\\n   He certainly wasn\\'t the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin go. The whole of Harry\\'s Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his resignation.\\n   \"Wonder what they\\'ll give us next year?\" said Seamus Finnigan gloomily.\\n   \"My dear Professor, I\\'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\\n   \"You\\'d be stiff if you\\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\n   \"An easy mistake to make,\" said Dumbledore softly. \"I expect you\\'ll tire of hearing it, but you do look extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes... you have your mother\\'s eyes.\\n   Harry shook his head.\\n   \"It\\'s lucky it\\'s dark. I haven\\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\"\\n   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said,\"The owls are nothing next to therumors that are flying around. You know what everyone\\'s saying? About why he\\'s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\"\\n   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever\"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\\n   \"What they\\'resaying,\" she pressed on,\"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\\'s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are-are-that they\\'re-dead.\"\\n   Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\\n   \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\\'s drive.\\n   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar-a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\\'t realize what he had seen-then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\\'t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive-no,looking at the sign; cats couldn\\'t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\n   But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\\'t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\\'t bear people who dressed in funny clothes-the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\\'t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt-these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\\n   Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\\'t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.He didn\\'t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\\'d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\\n   He\\'d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\\'s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\\'t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\\'t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\\n   \"This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew\\'s life.\"\\n   Harry couldn\\'t imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking.\\n   \"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\\'s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"\\n   She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\\'t, so she went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he reallyhas gone, Dumbledore?\"\\n   \"It didn\\'t make any difference,\" said Harry bitterly. \"Pettigrew got away.\"\\n   \"Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been.\" he said thoughtfully. \"Who\\'d have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise...\"\\n   \"Calm down, man!\" Fudge barked. \"You\\'re talking nonsense!\"\\n   \"YOU DON\\'T KNOW POTTER!\" shrieked Snape. \"HE DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT-\"\\n   \"That\\'ll be good enough for Dumbledore!\" said Harry happily. He looked back at Sirius\\'s letter. \"Hang on, there\\'s a PS...\"\\n   \\n    If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.\\n    I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter\\'s godfather, hereby give him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends.\\n   \\n   Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though he\\'d swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp.\\n   \\n   \"Hagrid would like that,\" said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry and Hermione. As he and Fudge left the dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she headed back to her office.\\n   There was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had woken up. They could see him sitting up, rubbing his head, looking around.\\n   \"What-what happened?\" he groaned. \"Harry? Why are we in here? Where\\'s Sirius? Where\\'s Lupin? What\\'s going on?\" Harry and Hermione looked at each other.\\n   \"You explain,\" said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate.\\n   * * *\\n   When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The sweltering, heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going, however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank. The stag had galloped toward him from there just last night...\\n   A shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very bleary eyed Hagrid, mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them.\\n   \"Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"An extraordinary achievement-not least, keeping it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father last night... You found him inside yourself.\"\\n   And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused thoughts.\\n   * * *\\n   Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached, Harry heard many different theories about what had really happened, but none of them came close to the truth.\\n   Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius\\'s escape.\\n   \"Indeed?\" said Dumbledore. \"Er-stranger than usual, you mean?\"\\n   \"Yes... her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said... she said Voldemort\\'s servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight... She said the servant would help him come back to power.\" Harry stared up at Dumbledore. \"And then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn\\'t remember anything she\\'d said. Was it-was she making a real prediction?\"\\n   Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.\\n   \"Even if I could, I wouldn\\'t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well-give him here, Hagrid-we\\'d better get this over with.\"\\n   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\\' house.\\n   \"Couldn\\'t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"\\n   \"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy\\'s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\'t even remember! Can\\'t you see how much better off he\\'ll be, growing up away from all that until he\\'s ready to take it?\"\\n   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said,\"Yes-yes, you\\'re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\\n   \"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\"\\n   \"But if he helps Voldemort back to power-\"\\n   \"Professor Dumbledore-yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very-very strange.\"\\n   \"Is that where-?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He\\'ll have that scar forever.\"\\n   \"Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my patients now?\"\\n   She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves jangling... And then, as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them...\\n   \"What was that?\" said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.\\n   Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door.\\n   \"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can\\'t stand it-Lily an\\' James dead-an\\' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles-\"\\n   \"Yes, yes, it\\'s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\\'ll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\\'s blankets, and then came back to the other two. \\n   \"AAAAARRRGH!\"\\n   Harry looked in the bowl again.\\n   \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\"\\n   Uncle Vernon chuckled.\"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just like his father. \\'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley\\'s hair.\\n   Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\n   \"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\'s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\\n   Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\\n   \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.\\n   \"No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly. \"I have burned it.\"\\n   \"It\\'s Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto\\'s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with atelevision.\"\\n   Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If itwas Monday-and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television-then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\\'s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun-last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\\'s old socks. Still,you weren\\'t eleven every day.\\n   Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\\'t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\\'d bought.\\n   \"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.\\n   Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\\'s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and-a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives-he didn\\'t belong to the library, so he\\'d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\\n   Mr.\\xa0H.\\xa0Potter\\n   The Cupboard under the Stairs\\n   4. THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\\n   Boa Constrictor, Brazil.\\n   \"Watching-spying-might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\\n   \"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they\\'refamous. You\\'refamous.\"\\n   \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.\\n   The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\\n   But Uncle Vernon didn\\'t believe him. No one ever did.\\n   The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\\'t make them happen.\\n   Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\\'t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that hecouldn\\'t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\\n   As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\\'t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didn\\'t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.* * *\\n   There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\\n   \"What? My-my mom and dad weren\\'t famous, were they?\"\\n   \"Yer great puddin\\' of a son don\\' need fattenin\\' anymore, Dursley, don\\' worry.\"\\n   He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\'t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \"I\\'m sorry, but I still don\\'t really know who you are.\"\\n   The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\\n   \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\\n   After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\\'s car and crushed it into a trash can-but at the moment it didn\\'t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\\n   Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly,\"So I\\'ll have thirty... thirty...\"\\n   \"Thirty six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two less than last year.\"\\n   \"Dinky Duddydums, don\\'t cry, Mummy won\\'t let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him.\\n   \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don\\'t ask questions.\"\\n   Dudley and Piers sniggered.\\n   \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"\\n   The snake nodded vigorously.\\n   \"Where\\'s my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who\\'s writing to me?\"\\n   \"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today-\"\\n   Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one-\\n   \"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.\\n   Dudley\\'s birthday-how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\\n   When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\\'s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise-unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\\'s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\\'t often catch him. Harry didn\\'t look it, but he was very fast.\\n   Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\\'s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\\n   \"It wasnot a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\"\\n   \"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\n   Aunt Petunia looked as though she\\'d just swallowed a lemon.\\n   \"Anyway-Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here-I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\\'ll taste all right.\"\\n   From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother,\"I don\\'twant him in there... Ineed that room... make him get out...\"\\n   Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\\'t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\\n   The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\\n   \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\"\\n   Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache:\"MOTORCYCLES DON\\'T FLY!\"\\n   Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\\'s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.\\n   They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\\n   \"Get the mail, Harry.\"\\n   \"Make Harry get it.\"\\n   \"Go to your cupboard-I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley-go-just go.\"\\n   Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel-Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\\n   Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\\'s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\\n   At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\\'s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\\'s gang.\\n   4 Privet Drive\\n   Little Whinging\\n   Surrey\\n   The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald green ink. There was no stamp.\\n   Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letterH.\\n   \"I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted.\\n   \"Make Dudley get it.\"\\n   \"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.\\n   \"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\"\\n   It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.\\n   \"That car\\'s new, he\\'s not sitting in it alone...\"\\n   Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\\n   \"Out! OUT!\"\\n   Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\\n   \"That\\'smine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\\n   \"Who\\'s there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you-I\\'m armed!\"\\n   There was a pause. Then-\\n   SMASH!\\n   The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\\n   A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them.\\n   \"I... don\\'t... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\\'s arms.\\n   Just then, the doorbell rang-\"Oh, good Lord, they\\'re here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically-and a moment later, Dudley\\'s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\\'s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\\n   Harry could see Uncle Vernon\\'s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.\\n   \"Nothing, nothing...\"\\n   Dudley\\'s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\\'s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\\'s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\\'d ever owned.\\n   \"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\\n   \"Was it nice there?\"\\n   The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:This specimen was bred in the zoo.\"Oh, I see-so you\\'ve never been to Brazil?\"\\n   As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said,\"Brazil, here I come... Thanksss, amigo.\"\\n   The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\\n   \"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\\'t want-\"\\n   Harry didn\\'t move.\\n   \"I demand that you leave at once, sir!\" he said. \"You are breaking and entering!\"\\n   \"All right, thirty seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\\n   BOOM.\\n   The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\\n   A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.\\n   \"Your new school uniform,\" she said.\\n   Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was,\"Who are you?\"\\n   The giant chuckled.\\n   \"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\\'d had the same dream before.\\n   His aunt was back outside the door.\\n   \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg. She can\\'t take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry\\'s direction.\\n   Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn\\'t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\\'d be able to steal one somehow.\\n   Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?\\n   One minute to go and he\\'d be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty... ten... nine-maybe he\\'d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him-three... two... one...\\n   BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.\"Where\\'s the cannon?\" he said stupidly.\\n   There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands-now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.\\n   \"Why?\" said Harry.\\n   \"Don\\'t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\"\\n   The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\\'t there-or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\\'t understand them, like a slug.\\n   \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door.\\n   \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\\'d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\\'t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\\n   \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\\'t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\\'s birthday.\"\\n   Harry had the best morning he\\'d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\\'t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\\'t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\\n   Harry groaned.\\n   \"What world?\"\\n   Hagrid looked shocked.\\n   \"Sorry?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows.\"It\\' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\\'t gettin\\' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\\'t even know abou\\' Hogwarts, fer cryin\\' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?\"\\n   \"An\\' here\\'s Harry!\" said the giant.\\n   Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.\\n   \"I\\'m awhat?\" gasped Harry.\\n   \"AAAAARRRGH!\"\\n   Harry looked in the bowl again.\\n   \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\"\\n   Uncle Vernon chuckled.\"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just like his father. \\'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley\\'s hair.\\n   Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\n   \"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\'s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\\n   Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\\n   \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.\\n   \"No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly. \"I have burned it.\"\\n   \"It\\'s Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto\\'s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with atelevision.\"\\n   Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If itwas Monday-and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television-then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\\'s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun-last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\\'s old socks. Still,you weren\\'t eleven every day.\\n   Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\\'t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\\'d bought.\\n   \"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.\\n   Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\\'s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and-a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives-he didn\\'t belong to the library, so he\\'d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\\n   Mr.\\xa0H.\\xa0Potter\\n   The Cupboard under the Stairs\\n   4. THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\\n   Boa Constrictor, Brazil.\\n   \"Watching-spying-might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\\n   \"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they\\'refamous. You\\'refamous.\"\\n   \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.\\n   The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\\n   But Uncle Vernon didn\\'t believe him. No one ever did.\\n   The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\\'t make them happen.\\n   Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\\'t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that hecouldn\\'t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\\n   As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\\'t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didn\\'t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.* * *\\n   There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\\n   \"What? My-my mom and dad weren\\'t famous, were they?\"\\n   \"Yer great puddin\\' of a son don\\' need fattenin\\' anymore, Dursley, don\\' worry.\"\\n   He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\'t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \"I\\'m sorry, but I still don\\'t really know who you are.\"\\n   The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\\n   \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\\n   After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\\'s car and crushed it into a trash can-but at the moment it didn\\'t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\\n   Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly,\"So I\\'ll have thirty... thirty...\"\\n   \"Thirty six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two less than last year.\"\\n   \"Dinky Duddydums, don\\'t cry, Mummy won\\'t let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him.\\n   \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don\\'t ask questions.\"\\n   Dudley and Piers sniggered.\\n   \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"\\n   The snake nodded vigorously.\\n   \"Where\\'s my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who\\'s writing to me?\"\\n   \"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today-\"\\n   Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one-\\n   \"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.\\n   Dudley\\'s birthday-how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\\n   When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen.

The woman stared.\\n   \"I\\'m awhat?\" gasped Harry.\\n   \"AAAAARRRGH!\"\\n   Harry looked in the bowl again.\\n   \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\"\\n   Uncle Vernon chuckled.\"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just like his father. \\'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley\\'s hair.\\n   Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\n   \"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\'s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\\n   Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\\n   \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.\\n   \"No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly. \"I have burned it.\"\\n   \"It\\'s Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto\\'s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with atelevision.\"\\n   Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If itwas Monday-and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television-then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\\'s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun-last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\\'s old socks. Still,you weren\\'t eleven every day.\\n   Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\\'t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\\'d bought.\\n   \"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.\\n   Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\\'s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and-a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives-he didn\\'t belong to the library, so he\\'d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\\n   Mr.\\xa0H.\\xa0Potter\\n   The Cupboard under the Stairs\\n   4. THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\\n   Boa Constrictor, Brazil.\\n   \"Watching-spying-might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\\n   \"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they\\'refamous. You\\'refamous.\"\\n   \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.\\n   The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\\n   But Uncle Vernon didn\\'t believe him. No one ever did.\\n   The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\\'t make them happen.\\n   Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\\'t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that hecouldn\\'t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\\n   As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\\'t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didn\\'t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.* * *\\n   There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\\n   \"What? My-my mom and dad weren\\'t famous, were they?\"\\n   \"Yer great puddin\\' of a son don\\' need fattenin\\' anymore, Dursley, don\\' worry.\"\\n   He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\'t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \"I\\'m sorry, but I still don\\'t really know who you are.\"\\n   The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\\n   \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\\n   After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\\'s car and crushed it into a trash can-but at the moment it didn\\'t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\\n   Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly,\"So I\\'ll have thirty... thirty...\"\\n   \"Thirty six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two less than last year.\"\\n   \"Dinky Duddydums, don\\'t cry, Mummy won\\'t let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him.\\n   \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don\\'t ask questions.\"\\n   Dudley and Piers sniggered.\\n   \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"\\n   The snake nodded vigorously.\\n   \"Where\\'s my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who\\'s writing to me?\"\\n   \"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today-\"\\n   Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one-\\n   \"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.\\n   Dudley\\'s birthday-how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\\n   When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\\'s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise-unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\\'s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\\'t often catch him. Harry didn\\'t look it, but he was very fast.\\n   Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\\'s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\\n   \"It wasnot a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\"\\n   \"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\n   Aunt Petunia looked as though she\\'d just swallowed a lemon.\\n   \"Anyway-Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here-I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\\'ll taste all right.\"\\n   From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother,\"I don\\'twant him in there... Ineed that room... make him get out...\"\\n   Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\\'t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\\n   The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\\n   \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\"\\n   Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache:\"MOTORCYCLES DON\\'T FLY!\"\\n   Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\\'s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.\\n   They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\\n   \"Get the mail, Harry.\"\\n   \"Make Harry get it.\"\\n   \"Go to your cupboard-I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley-go-just go.\"\\n   Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel-Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\\n   Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\\'s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\\n   At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\\'s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\\'s gang.\\n   4 Privet Drive\\n   Little Whinging\\n   Surrey\\n   The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald green ink. There was no stamp.\\n   Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letterH.\\n   \"I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted.\\n   \"Make Dudley get it.\"\\n   \"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.\\n   \"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\"\\n   It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.\\n   \"That car\\'s new, he\\'s not sitting in it alone...\"\\n   Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\\n   \"Out! OUT!\"\\n   Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\\n   \"That\\'smine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\\n   \"Who\\'s there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you-I\\'m armed!\"\\n   There was a pause. Then-\\n   SMASH!\\n   The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\\n   A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them.\\n   \"I... don\\'t... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\\'s arms.\\n   Just then, the doorbell rang-\"Oh, good Lord, they\\'re here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically-and a moment later, Dudley\\'s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scraw\\n   \"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\\n   Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least-but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.\\n   \"Could you write it down?\" Harry suggested.\\n   \"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\\n   \"I don\\'t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\\n   Hagrid was watching him sadly.\\n   \"Um-Hagrid?\"\\n   \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\\n   \"I think he\\'s brilliant,\" said Harry coldly.\\n   \"Don\\'t do that.\"\\n   Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\\'t noticed the night before, and read:\\n   Hagrid\\n   Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.\\n   \"Spells-enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \"They say there\\'s dragons guardin\\' the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way-Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\\'d die of hunger tryin\\' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\"\\n   Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\\'t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid\\'s coat.\\n   \"Don\\'t make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin\\'s.\\n   \"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it\\'s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An\\' it\\'s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\\' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\"\\n   \"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"\\n   Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\\n   \"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this-can this be ?\"\\n   The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\\n   \"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\\' how little yeh know-not knowin\\' about Quidditch!\"\\n   \"Don\\'t worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \"D\\'yeh think yer parents didn\\'t leave yeh anything?\"\\n   \"But what does a Ministry of Magicdo?\"\\n   \"Well-I don\\' like sayin\\' the name if I can help it. No one does.\"\\n   \"Why were you expelled?\"\\n   \"It\\'s our sport. Wizard sport. It\\'s like-like soccer in the Muggle world-everyone follows Quidditch-played up in the air on broomsticks and there\\'s four balls-sorta hard ter explain the rules.\"\\n   \"Be grateful if yeh didn\\'t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he said. \"I\\'m-er-not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\\'. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\\' get yer letters to yeh an\\' stuff-one o\\' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job-\"\\n   \"Why not?\"\\n   \"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \"There\\'s an owl-\"\\n   \"Play Quidditch at all?\"\\n   \"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n   \"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I\\'d like a dragon.\"\\n   \"You-Know-Who killed \\'em. An\\' then-an\\' this is the real myst\\'ry of the thing-he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\\' by then. But he couldn\\'t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\\'s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh-took care of yer mum an\\' dad an\\' yer house, even-but it didn\\'t work on you, an\\' that\\'s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \\'em, no one except you, an\\' he\\'d killed some o\\' the best witches an\\' wizards of the age-the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts-an\\' you was only a baby, an\\' you lived.\"\\n   Something very painful was going on in Harry\\'s mind. As Hagrid\\'s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before-and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\\n   Hagrid wouldn\\'t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says pewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\\n   \"\\'Course,\" said Hagrid. \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\\' course, but he\\'d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin\\' fer advice.\"\\n   \"But what happened to Vol-, sorry-I mean, You-Know-Who?\"\\n   \"Good,\" said Hagrid. \"There\\'s a list there of everything yeh need.\"\\n   Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n   \"What?\"\\n   \"He\\'s not going,\" he said.\\n   Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.\\n   \"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he\\'d rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You\\'ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\\'ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought.\\n   COURSE BOOKS\\n   And there\\'s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\\'t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\\n   Tap. Tap. Tap.\\n   \"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.\\n   All students should have a copy of each of the following:\\n   The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk\\n   A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium-Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\\'s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand-fastest ever-\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\\' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon...\\n   \"Gulpin\\' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...\"\\n   Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\\n   \"The little bronze ones.\"\\n   Harry didn\\'t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.\\n   Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n   \"Flew,\" said Hagrid.\\n   \"Gallopin\\' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl-a real, live, rather ruffled looking owl-a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tonguebetween his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\\n   Deputy Headmistress\\n   Questions exploded inside Harry\\'s head like fireworks and he couldn\\'t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does it mean, they await my owl?\"\\n   \"Give him five Knuts,\" said Hagrid sleepily.\\n   \"Like I said, Yeh\\'d be mad ter try an\\' rob it,\" said Hagrid.\\n   A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\\n   \"School houses. There\\'s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\\' duffers, but-\"\\n   \"I do-Father says it\\'s a crime if I\\'m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\\'ll be in yet?\"\\n   \"No,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\"\\n   \"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\n   \"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\\n   \"He\\'s the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Nah can\\'t spell it. All right-Voldemort.\" Hagrid shuddered.\"Don\\'t make me say it again. Anyway, this-this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin\\' fer followers. Got \\'em, too-some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o\\' his power, \\'cause he was gettin\\' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\\'t know who ter trust, didn\\'t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened. He was takin\\' over. \\'Course, some stood up to him-an\\' he killed \\'em. Horribly. One o\\' the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\\'s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\\'t dare trytakin\\' the school, not jus\\' then, anyway.\\n   \"Now, you listen here, boy,\" he snarled, \"I accept there\\'s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\\'t have cured-and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world\\'s better off without them in my opinion-asked forall they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types-just what I expected, always knew they\\'d come to a sticky end-\"\\n   But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said,\"That\\'s you done, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\\n   \"Well, it\\'s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh-mind, I can\\'t tell yeh everythin\\', it\\'s a great myst\\'ry, parts of it...\"\\n   He sat up and Hagrid\\'s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.\\n   Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\\n   \"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake. I don\\'t think I can be a wizard.\"\\n   To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n   \"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what\\'s Quidditch?\"\\n   \"But if their house was destroyed-\"\\n   \"They were a witch and wizard, if that\\'s what you mean.\"\\n   \"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\\'t come in.\\n   \"That\\'s better,\" said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\\n   He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley-there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\\'s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\\n   Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\\n   Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\\n   Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, theDaily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\\'d never had so many questions in his life.\\n   \"Mm?\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\\n   \"I never expected this,\" he said, in a low, worried voice. \"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\\' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn\\'t know. Ah, Harry, I don\\' know if I\\'m the right person ter tell yeh-but someone\\'s gotta-yeh can\\'t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\\'.\"\\n   He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\\n   \"You have his key, sir?\"\\n   \"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\\n   The goblin looked at it closely.\\n   \"That\\'s Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\\'t. \"He works at Hogwarts.\"\\n   \"One speed only,\" said Griphook.\\n   They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\\n   Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\\n   \"Still got yer letter, Harry?\" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\\n   \"Got everythin\\'? Come on, then.\"\\n   Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said,\"Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\"\\n   \"Can we buy all this in London?\" Harry wondered aloud.\\n   \"Is he always that nervous?\"\\n   \"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I\\'ve heard of him. He\\'s a sort of servant, isn\\'t he?\"\\n   \"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\"\\n   \"You can kip under that,\" he said. \"Don\\' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\\' dormice in one o\\' the pockets.\"\\n   A Beginners\\' Guide to Transfiguration by Emetic Switch\\n   One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore\\n   Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling\\n   A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot\\n   Minerva McGonagall,\\n   Doris Crockford shook Harry\\'s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\\n   Hagrid grunted.\\n   \"I\\'m not sayin\\' that\\'s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' anyway, yeh couldn\\' work any of the curses yet, yeh\\'ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\"\\n   Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\\n   \"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There\\'s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\\'t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\"\\n   \"Wanted one ever since I was a kid-here we go.\"\\n   They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes\\' time. Hagrid, who didn\\'t understand \"Muggle money,\" as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\\n   People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent.\\n   \"That seems to be in order.\"\\n   \"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\"\\n   \"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard-you wait, you\\'ll be right famous at Hogwarts.\"\\n   But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said,\"I\\'m warning you, Dursley-I\\'m warning you-one more word...\"\\n   In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.\\n   \"Hogwarts, dear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot here-another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\"\\n   It was a tiny, grubby looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\\'t pointed it out, Harry wouldn\\'t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\\'t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\\'t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\\n   Given Harry his letter.\\n   Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.\\n   Weather\\'s horrible. Hope you\\'re well.\\n   Hagrid grinned at Harry.\\n   \"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\\'s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot...\"\\n   \"Maybe he thought he could persuade \\'em... maybe he just wanted \\'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an\\'-an\\'-\"\\n   Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\\'t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\\'t help trusting him.\\n   \"Three up... two across,\" he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\"\\n   He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\\n   \"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\\'ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been-imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\\'d leave, wouldn\\'t you?\"\\n   \"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We\\'ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\\'s safe.\"\\n   \"You knew?\" said Harry. \"Youknew I\\'m a-a wizard?\"\\n   \"Knuts?\"\\n   \"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you\\'d be just the same, just as strange, just as-as-abnormal-and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\"\\n   Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\n   \"I haven\\'t got any money-and you heard Uncle Vernon last night... he won\\'t pay for me to go and learn magic.\"\\n   \"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\\'t believe I\\'m meeting you at last.\"\\n   \"So whatis Quidditch?\"\\n   \"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\"\\n   Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\\n   \"How often do you check to see if anyone\\'s inside?\" Harry asked.\\n   \"All right,\" Harry mumbled, \"I\\'m getting up.\"\\n   He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\\n   The brick he had touched quivered-it wriggled-in the middle, a small hole appeared-it grew wider and wider-a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\\n   \"Well, I\\'ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy.\\n   Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\n   \"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again-Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\\n   All Harry\\'s-it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\\'t have known about this or they\\'d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\\n   Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\\'d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\\'t they been turned into warty toads every time they\\'d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\\'d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley hadalways been able to kick him around like a football?\\n   \"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say there aredragons at Gringotts?\"\\n   \"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\\'s still witches an\\' wizards up an\\' down the country.\"\\n   \"Wizards havebanks?\"\\n   \"Knew!\" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly.\"Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that-thatschool-and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was-a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\"\\n   She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.\\n   \"There\\'s a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop himself.\\n   \"-and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\\'t even be allowed in.\"\\n   \"Yes, exactly. I heard he\\'s a sort ofsavage-lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\"\\n   \"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\"\\n   \"I\\'ve seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\\'s top hat fell off in his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop.\"\\n   \"He wants payin\\' fer deliverin\\' the paper. Look in the pockets.\"\\n   Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.\\n   Hagrid\\'s coat seemed to be made of nothingbut pockets-bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags... finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins.\\n   \"Goblins?\"\\n   \"Years an\\' years ago,\" said Hagrid.\\n   They bought Harry\\'s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away fromCurses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\\n   \"I\\'d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\" he said.\\n   \"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\\n   Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least-but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.\\n   \"Could you write it down?\" Harry suggested.\\n   \"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\\n   \"I don\\'t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\\n   Hagrid was watching him sadly.\\n   \"Um-Hagrid?\"\\n   \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\\n   \"I think he\\'s brilliant,\" said Harry coldly.\\n   \"Don\\'t do that.\"\\n   Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\\'t noticed the night before, and read:\\n   Hagrid\\n   Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.\\n   \"Spells-enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \"They say there\\'s dragons guardin\\' the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way-Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\\'d die of hunger tryin\\' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\"\\n   Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\\'t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid\\'s coat.\\n   \"Don\\'t make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin\\'s.\\n   \"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it\\'s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An\\' it\\'s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\\' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\"\\n   \"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"\\n   Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\\n   \"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this-can this be ?\"\\n   The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\\n   \"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\\' how little yeh know-not knowin\\' about Quidditch!\"\\n   \"Don\\'t worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \"D\\'yeh think yer parents didn\\'t leave yeh anything?\"\\n   \"But what does a Ministry of Magicdo?\"\\n   \"Well-I don\\' like sayin\\' the name if I can help it. No one does.\"\\n   \"Why were you expelled?\"\\n   \"It\\'s our sport. Wizard sport. It\\'s like-like soccer in the Muggle world-everyone follows Quidditch-played up in the air on broomsticks and there\\'s four balls-sorta hard ter explain the rules.\"\\n   \"Be grateful if yeh didn\\'t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he said. \"I\\'m-er-not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\\'. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\\' get yer letters to yeh an\\' stuff-one o\\' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job-\"\\n   \"Why not?\"\\n   \"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \"There\\'s an owl-\"\\n   \"Play Quidditch at all?\"\\n   \"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n   \"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I\\'d like a dragon.\"\\n   \"You-Know-Who killed \\'em. An\\' then-an\\' this is the real myst\\'ry of the thing-he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\\' by then. But he couldn\\'t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\\'s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh-took care of yer mum an\\' dad an\\' yer house, even-but it didn\\'t work on you, an\\' that\\'s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \\'em, no one except you, an\\' he\\'d killed some o\\' the best witches an\\' wizards of the age-the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts-an\\' you was only a baby, an\\' you lived.\"\\n   Something very painful was going on in Harry\\'s mind. As Hagrid\\'s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before-and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\\n   Hagrid wouldn\\'t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says pewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\\n   \"\\'Course,\" said Hagrid. \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\\' course, but he\\'d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin\\' fer advice.\"\\n   \"But what happened to Vol-, sorry-I mean, You-Know-Who?\"\\n   \"Good,\" said Hagrid. \"There\\'s a list there of everything yeh need.\"\\n   Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n   \"What?\"\\n   \"He\\'s not going,\" he said.\\n   Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.\\n   \"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he\\'d rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You\\'ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\\'ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought.\\n   COURSE BOOKS\\n   And there\\'s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\\'t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\\n   Tap. Tap. Tap.\\n   \"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.\\n   All students should have a copy of each of the following:\\n   The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk\\n   A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium-Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\\'s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand-fastest ever-\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\\' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon...\\n   \"Gulpin\\' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...\"\\n   Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\\n   \"The little bronze ones.\"\\n   Harry didn\\'t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.\\n   Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n   \"Flew,\" said Hagrid.\\n   \"Gallopin\\' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl-a real, live, rather ruffled looking owl-a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tonguebetween his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\\n   Deputy Headmistress\\n   Questions exploded inside Harry\\'s head like fireworks and he couldn\\'t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does it mean, they await my owl?\"\\n   \"Give him five Knuts,\" said Hagrid sleepily.\\n   \"Like I said, Yeh\\'d be mad ter try an\\' rob it,\" said Hagrid.\\n   A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\\n   \"School houses. There\\'s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\\' duffers, but-\"\\n   \"I do-Father says it\\'s a crime if I\\'m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\\'ll be in yet?\"\\n   \"No,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\"\\n   \"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\n   \"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\\n   \"He\\'s the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Nah can\\'t spell it. All right-Voldemort.\" Hagrid shuddered.\"Don\\'t make me say it again. Anyway, this-this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin\\' fer followers. Got \\'em, too-some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o\\' his power, \\'cause he was gettin\\' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\\'t know who ter trust, didn\\'t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened. He was takin\\' over. \\'Course, some stood up to him-an\\' he killed \\'em. Horribly. One o\\' the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\\'s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\\'t dare trytakin\\' the school, not jus\\' then, anyway.\\n   \"Now, you listen here, boy,\" he snarled, \"I accept there\\'s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\\'t have cured-and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world\\'s better off without them in my opinion-asked forall they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types-just what I expected, always knew they\\'d come to a sticky end-\"\\n   But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said,\"That\\'s you done, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\\n   \"Well, it\\'s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh-mind, I can\\'t tell yeh everythin\\', it\\'s a great myst\\'ry, parts of it...\"\\n   He sat up and Hagrid\\'s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.\\n   Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\\n   \"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake. I don\\'t think I can be a wizard.\"\\n   To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n   \"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what\\'s Quidditch?\"\\n   \"But if their house was destroyed-\"\\n   \"They were a witch and wizard, if that\\'s what you mean.\"\\n   \"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\\'t come in.\\n   \"That\\'s better,\" said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\\n   He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley-there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\\'s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\\n   Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\\n   Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\\n   Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, theDaily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\\'d never had so many questions in his life.\\n   \"Mm?\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\\n   \"I never expected this,\" he said, in a low, worried voice. \"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\\' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn\\'t know. Ah, Harry, I don\\' know if I\\'m the right person ter tell yeh-but someone\\'s gotta-yeh can\\'t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\\'.\"\\n   He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\\n   \"You have his key, sir?\"\\n   \"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\\n   The goblin looked at it closely.\\n   \"That\\'s Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\\'t. \"He works at Hogwarts.\"\\n   \"One speed only,\" said Griphook.\\n   They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\\n   Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\\n   \"Still got yer letter, Harry?\" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\\n   \"Got everythin\\'? Come on, then.\"\\n   Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said,\"Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\"\\n   \"Can we buy all this in London?\" Harry wondered aloud.\\n   \"Is he always that nervous?\"\\n   \"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I\\'ve heard of him. He\\'s a sort of servant, isn\\'t he?\"\\n   \"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\"\\n   \"You can kip under that,\" he said. \"Don\\' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\\' dormice in one o\\' the pockets.\"\\n   A Beginners\\' Guide to Transfiguration by Emetic Switch\\n   One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore\\n   Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling\\n   A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot\\n   Minerva McGonagall,\\n   Doris Crockford shook Harry\\'s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\\n   Hagrid grunted.\\n   \"I\\'m not sayin\\' that\\'s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' anyway, yeh couldn\\' work any of the curses yet, yeh\\'ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\"\\n   Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\\n   \"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There\\'s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\\'t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\"\\n   \"Wanted one ever since I was a kid-here we go.\"\\n   They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes\\' time. Hagrid, who didn\\'t understand \"Muggle money,\" as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\\n   People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent.\\n   \"That seems to be in order.\"\\n   \"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\"\\n   \"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard-you wait, you\\'ll be right famous at Hogwarts.\"\\n   But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said,\"I\\'m warning you, Dursley-I\\'m warning you-one more word...\"\\n   In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.\\n   \"Hogwarts, dear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot here-another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\"\\n   It was a tiny, grubby looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\\'t pointed it out, Harry wouldn\\'t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\\'t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\\'t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\\n   Given Harry his letter.\\n   Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.\\n   Weather\\'s horrible. Hope you\\'re well.\\n   Hagrid grinned at Harry.\\n   \"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\\'s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot...\"\\n   \"Maybe he thought he could persuade \\'em... maybe he just wanted \\'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an\\'-an\\'-\"\\n   Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\\'t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\\'t help trusting him.\\n   \"Three up... two across,\" he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\"\\n   He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\\n   \"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\\'ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been-imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\\'d leave, wouldn\\'\\n   \"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I\\'d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\" It wasn\\'t a question. \"You have your mother\\'s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\"\\n   Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\\'s forehead with a long, white finger.\\n   \"Is it true?\" he said. \"They\\'re saying all down the train that Harry Potter\\'s in this compartment. So it\\'s you, is it?\"\\n   \"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him...\"\\n   He pointed at Harry\\'s forehead.\\n   Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.\\n   \"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n   \"It\\'s on my ticket.\"\\n   \"Because he\\'s aprefect,\" said their mother fondly.\"All right, dear, well, have a good term-send me an owl when you get there.\"\\n   She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\\n   \"Oh well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\\'s jokes,\" said Ron. \"And have you really got-you know...\"\\n   He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.\\n   He stopped a passing guard, but didn\\'t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\\'t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\\'clock, but the guard said there wasn\\'t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it;he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\\n   Harry didn\\'t say anything.\\n   \"Where\\'s Percy?\" said their mother.\\n   \"He\\'s gone!\"\\n   \"Well-I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\"\\n   \"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\\n   \"You said You-Know-Who\\'s name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed.\"I\\'d have thought you, of all people-\"\\n   \"I\\'m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly. \"Thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I\\'d known what that wand was going out into the world to do...\"\\n   He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he\\'d be in trouble-leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run-the barrier was coming nearer and nearer-he wouldn\\'t be able to stop-the cart was out of control-he was a foot away-he closed his eyes ready for the crash-\\n   Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\\n   \"I\\'m Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered.\\n   \"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\"\\n   \"Can\\'t stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I\\'m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves-\"\\n   \"Oh, are you doing magic? Let\\'s see it, then.\"\\n   She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\\n   \"Er-okay,\" said Harry.\\n   He put Harry\\'s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \"Curious... curious...\"\\n   \"Sothis is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.\\n   \"Don\\'t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\"\\n   \"Shut up,\" said Ron.\\n   \"Who?\"\\n   \"Harry Potter,\" chorused the twins.\\n   \"Oh, no, sir,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.\\n   \"Hold out your arm. That\\'s it.\" He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\\'s wand.\"\\n   Harry swallowed.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can\\'t remember it.\"\\n   \"Now, what\\'s the platform number?\" said the boys\\' mother.\\n   \"Nine and three-quarters.\"\\n   \"Don\\'t tell me you\\'d never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa-thanks-\"\\n   Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore\\'s face had disappeared.\\n   \"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron\\'s new, too.\"\\n   She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.\\n   \"Oh,Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh.\\n   A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\\n   The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door readOllivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\n   A whistle sounded.\\n   \"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\\n   \"I know I don\\'t have to. Tell yeh what, I\\'ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\\'d be laughed at-an\\' I don\\' like cats, they make me sneeze. I\\'ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they\\'re dead useful, carry yer mail an\\' everythin\\'.\"\\n   Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\\'t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\\n   \"Don\\' you worry, Harry. You\\'ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you\\'ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\\'s hard. Yeh\\'ve been singled out, an\\' that\\'s always hard. But yeh\\'ll have a great time at Hogwarts-I did-still do, \\'smatter of fact.\"\\n   Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.\\n   \"Don\\'t know why he\\'s so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I\\'d brought a toad I\\'d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\\'t talk.\"\\n   The rat was still snoozing on Ron\\'s lap.\\n   \"He\\'ll turn up,\" said Harry.\\n   \"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\" said Hagrid.\\n   Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn\\'t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.\\n   The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.\\n   \"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.\\n   \"Er-all right.\"\\n   He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\\n   \"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\\'s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\\'d have to ask someone.\\n   He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\\n   \"George!\"\\n   \"Or twice-\"\\n   \"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the twins.\\n   \"So that\\'s where You-Know-Who-?\"\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is-the thing is, I don\\'t know how to-\"\\n   \"Hungry, are you?\"\\n   \"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on-\"\\n   \"You know that black haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\"\\n   \"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.\\n   \"Thank you.\"\\n   He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.\\n   \"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren\\'t you?\" he added to Harry.\\n   \"What?\" said Harry.\\n   \"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say every flavor, theymean every flavor-you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\"\\n   Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\\n   \"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you-\"\\n   \"He might have died and you wouldn\\'t know the difference,\" said Ron in disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn\\'t work. I\\'ll show you, look...\"\\n   He shook his head and then, to Harry\\'s relief, spotted Hagrid.\\n   \"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\\n   \"Hey, Ron.\"\\n   The twins were back.\\n   \"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try-\"\\n   Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.\\n   \"Unicorn hair\\'s nearly poking out. Anyway-\"\\n   He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry-but the woman didn\\'t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\\'s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\\n   Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.\\n   \"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye, and their younger sister began to cry.\\n   \"Er-I don\\'t know any,\" Harry confessed.\\n   \"What\\'s that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\\'s lightning scar.\\n   \"Blown up a toilet? We\\'ve never blown up a toilet.\"\\n   \"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don\\'t know what they\\'ll say if I\\'m not. I don\\'t suppose Ravenclawwould be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\"\\n   \"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\\'ll find the perfect match here somewhere-I wonder, now-yes, why not-unusual combination-holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\"\\n   Harry tried-but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\\n   \"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I\\'m missing Agrippa.\"\\n   \"What?\" said Harry.\\n   \"Harry Potter,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Are you sure that\\'s a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it\\'s not very good, is it? I\\'ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\\'s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\\'s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\\'s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\\'ve heard-I\\'ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough-I\\'m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\"\\n   She said all this very fast.\\n   Harry nodded.\\n   \"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...\"\\n   \"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it-it\\'s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\"\\n   Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\\n   6. THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS\\n   Harry, who hadn\\'t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\\'s ears went pink again and he muttered that he\\'d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.\\n   He left.\\n   \"Don\\'t talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine and three-quarters.\"\\n   \"It\\'snot funny. And look after Ron.\"\\n   \"Don\\'t, Ginny, we\\'ll send you loads of owls.\"\\n   \"We\\'ve already told him we haven\\'t seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn\\'t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\\n   \"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\"\\n   The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train\\'s open door.\\n   \"Funny way to get to a wizards\\' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\"\\n   Harry didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he\\'d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\\'s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\\n   \"A minute-\"\\n   \"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed.\\n   \"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said.\\n   He cleared his throat.\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\"\\n   Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\\n   \"Now, you two-this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\\'ve-you\\'ve blown up a toilet or-\"\\n   \"But you don\\'tuse them?\" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\\n   \"Oh, of course, you wouldn\\'t know-Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect-famous witches and wizards. I\\'ve got about five hundred, but I haven\\'t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\"\\n   Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he\\'d finished school.\\n   \"Coming, Mom.\"\\n   With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\\n   Harry shivered. He wasn\\'t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.\\n   The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\\'t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn\\'t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\\'s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\\n   \"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\"\\n   \"Just yer wand left-A yeah, an\\' I still haven\\'t got yeh a birthday present.\"\\n   Harry heard the little girl\\'s voice.\\n   \"Oh, are you aprefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\"\\n   \"Harry Potter!\"\\n   Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found inA History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\\'t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.\\n   Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\\'s list again.\\n   \"Listen, we\\'re going down the middle of the train-Lee Jordan\\'s got a giant tarantula down there.\"\\n   \"Ron, you\\'ve got something on your nose.\"\\n   The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.\\n   \"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\"\\n   Their mother suddenly became very stern.\\n   \"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\"\\n   \"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins.\\n   \"Bleaaargh-see? Sprouts.\"\\n   They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn\\'t touch, which turned out to be pepper.\\n   The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.\\n   There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful.\\n   \"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"butwhat\\'s curious?\"\\n   Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\\n   \"Anyone sitting there?\" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \"Everywhere else is full.\"\\n   Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn\\'t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans.\\n   \"You won\\'t be. There\\'s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\"\\n   While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\\n   At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.\\n   \"...and until Hagrid told me, I didn\\'t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort-\"\\n   Ron gasped.\\n   \"Whatever house I\\'m in, I hope she\\'s not in it,\" said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell-George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\"\\n   \"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it\\'s the best game in the world-\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he\\'d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he\\'d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\\'t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\\n   Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\\'s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he\\'d shown back in Diagon Alley.\\n   \"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid.\\n   \"Goodness, didn\\'t you know, I\\'d have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what house you\\'ll be in? I\\'ve been asking around, and I hope I\\'m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\\'t be too bad... Anyway, we\\'d better go and look for Neville\\'s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\\'ll be there soon.\"\\n   Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,\"Anything off the cart, dears?\"\\n   He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\\n   \"You don\\'t have to-\"\\n   \"I remember every wand I\\'ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather-just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when it\\'s brother-why, it\\'s brother gave you that scar.\"\\n   Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry\\'s in front of him-and they had anowl.\\n   His aunt and uncle stared.\\n   \"Poordear-no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\"\\n   \"Nine and three-quarters!\" piped a small girl, also red headed, who was holding her hand, \"Mom, can\\'t I go...\"\\n   \"You\\'ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\\'t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\"\\n   \"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You\\'ll see. You just wait. All right, we\\'ll take you to King\\'s Cross. We\\'re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\\'t bother.\"\\n   \"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\"\\n   Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.\\n   \"Yes, please,\" Harry panted.\\n   \"Platform what?\"\\n   \"No, no here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\"\\n   Harry turned over his card and read:\\n   An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.\\n   \"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\"\\n   \"Don\\' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don\\' expect you\\'ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivander\\'s left now-only place fer wands, Ollivander\\'s, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\"\\n   A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.\\n   \"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\\n   \"Everyone thinks I\\'m special,\" he said at last. \"All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don\\'t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\\'m famous and I can\\'t even remember what I\\'m famous for. I don\\'t know what happened when Vol-sorry-I mean, the night my parents died.\"\\n   Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\\'s stand between platforms nine and ten.\\n   CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\n   Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\\n   \"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\\n   \"What\\'s your favorite Quidditch team?\" Ron asked.\\n   \"Er-I need to be at King\\'s Cross tomorrow to-to go to Hogwarts.\"\\n   Uncle Vernon grunted again.\\n   \"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\\n   \"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out.\\n   Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.\\n   \"We\\'ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\"\\n   \"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\"\\n   The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\\n   Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\\n   \"So you must know loads of magic already.\"\\n   The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\\n   \"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o\\'clock,\" he read.\\n   It didn\\'t come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o\\'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been, with the wordsPlatform Nine and Three-quarters on it. He had done it.\\n   Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.\\n   The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round faced boy who was saying,\"Gran, I\\'ve lost my toad again.\"\\n   \"Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone-but how had he done it?\\n   On the last day of August he thought he\\'d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\\'s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.\\n   \"Er-Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom\\'s got a second cousin who\\'s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\"\\n   \"Sorry, George, dear.\"\\n   \"Only joking, Mom.\"\\n   The train began to move. Harry saw the boys\\' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\\n   Harry woke at five o\\'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn\\'t want to walk into the station in his wizard\\'s robes-he\\'d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\\'s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys\\' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\\n   They reached King\\'s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry\\'s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\\n   \"Well, you can\\'t expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He\\'ll be back. No, I\\'ve got Morgana again and I\\'ve got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting.\"\\n   Ron\\'s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\\n   \"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\"\\n   Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn\\'t learned all the course books by heart either.\\n   \"I\\'m not Fred, I\\'m George,\" said the boy. \"Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can\\'t youtell I\\'m George?\"\\n   \"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\"\\n   When they shook their heads, he wailed,\"I\\'ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\"\\n   \"He\\'s coming now.\"\\n   The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letterP on it.\\n   \"Charlie\\'s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\\'s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about Gringotts? It\\'s been all over theDaily Prophet, but I don\\'t suppose you get that with the Muggles-someone tried to rob a high security vault.\"\\n   Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.\\n   \"That\\'s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\"\\n   \"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,\" he said. \"First o\\' September-King\\'s Cross-it\\'s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\\'ll know where to find me... See yeh soon, Harry.\"\\n   The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\\n   A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\\n   \"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\\'s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\\n   \"What house are your brothers in?\" asked Harry.\\n   \"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the other twin. \"Once-\"\\n   \"Oy, Fred! C\\'mere and help!\"\\n   With the twins\\' help, Harry\\'s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.\\n   \"That will do,\" he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \"Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.\"\\n   Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried,\"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious...\"\\n   He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\\n   \"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red haired twins he\\'d followed through the barrier.\\n   \"Yes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things-terrible, yes, but great.\"\\n   Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\\'t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.\\n   \"His name\\'s Scabbers and he\\'s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\\'t aff-I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\"\\n   Ron\\'s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\\'d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.\\n   Harry felt himself go red.\\n   \"You don\\'t want this, it\\'s all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn\\'t got much time,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\"\\n   \"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.\\n   And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\\n   \"Where is this school, anyway?\"\\n   \"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\\'t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\"\\n   \"All summer-\"\\n   \"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \"And my name\\'s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\"\\n   \"-packed with Muggles, of course-\"\\n   Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\\n   \"Mom-geroff-\" He wriggled free.\\n   \"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I\\'d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\" It wasn\\'t a question. \"You have your mother\\'s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\"\\n   Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\\'s forehead with a long, white finger.\\n   \"Is it true?\" he said. \"They\\'re saying all down the train that Harry Potter\\'s in this compartment. So it\\'s you, is it?\"\\n   \"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him...\"\\n   He pointed at Harry\\'s forehead.\\n   Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.\\n   \"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n   \"It\\'s on my ticket.\"\\n   \"Because he\\'s aprefect,\" said their mother fondly.\"All right, dear, well, have a good term-send me an owl when you get there.\"\\n   She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\\n   \"Oh well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\\'s jokes,\" said Ron. \"And have you really got-you know...\"\\n   He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.\\n   He stopped a passing guard, but didn\\'t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\\'t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\\'clock, but the guard said there wasn\\'t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it;he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\\n   Harry didn\\'t say anything.\\n   \"Where\\'s Percy?\" said their mother.\\n   \"He\\'s gone!\"\\n   \"Well-I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\"\\n   \"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\\n   \"You said You-Know-Who\\'s name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed.\"I\\'d have thought you, of all people-\"\\n   \"I\\'m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly. \"Thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I\\'d known what that wand was going out into the world to do...\"\\n   He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he\\'d be in trouble-leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run-the barrier was coming nearer and nearer-he wouldn\\'t be able to stop-the cart was out of control-he was a foot away-he closed his eyes ready for the crash-\\n   Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\\n   \"I\\'m Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered.\\n   \"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\"\\n   \"Can\\'t stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I\\'m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves-\"\\n   \"Oh, are you doing magic? Let\\'s see it, then.\"\\n   She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\\n   \"Er-okay,\" said Harry.\\n   He put Harry\\'s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \"Curious... curious...\"\\n   \"Sothis is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.\\n   \"Don\\'t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\"\\n   \"Shut up,\" said Ron.\\n   \"Who?\"\\n   \"Harry Potter,\" chorused the twins.\\n   \"Oh, no, sir,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.\\n   \"Hold out your arm. That\\'s it.\" He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\\'s wand.\"\\n   Harry swallowed.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can\\'t remember it.\"\\n   \"Now, what\\'s the platform number?\" said the boys\\' mother.\\n   \"Nine and three-quarters.\"\\n   \"Don\\'t tell me you\\'d never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa-thanks-\"\\n   Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore\\'s face had disappeared.\\n   \"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron\\'s new, too.\"\\n   She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.\\n   \"Oh,Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh.\\n   A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\\n   The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door readOllivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\n   A whistle sounded.\\n   \"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\\n   \"I know I don\\'t have to. Tell yeh what, I\\'ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\\'d be laughed at-an\\' I don\\' like cats, they make me sneeze. I\\'ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they\\'re dead useful, carry yer mail an\\' everythin\\'.\"\\n   Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\\'t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Profess\\n   \"An\\' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\\'d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\\'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\\'t get rid of her-Fitch puts her up to it.\"\\n   Harry was going to ask Ron if he\\'d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\\n   Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\n   Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\\'s name.\\n   \"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"\\n   The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\\'s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hangingtapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\\n   A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\\'s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\\n   \"So we\\'ve just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I\\'ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"\\n   Harry told Hagrid about Snape\\'s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\n   \"But we don\\'t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\\'ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\"\\n   Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\\n   \"C\\'mon, follow me-any more firs\\' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\\' years follow me!\"\\n   Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\\n   \"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word-like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\\'t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death-if you aren\\'t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"\\n   Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\\'d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\\n   Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\\n   \"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron\\'ll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy.\\n   Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase-they were obviously in one of the towers-they found their beds at last: five four posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\\n   \"HUFFLEPUFF!\"\\n   Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide.\"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\\n   \"Great food, isn\\'t it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \"Getoff, Scabbers! He\\'s chewing my sheets.\"\\n   Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\\'t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\\'t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\\'t have much of a head start.\\n   GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\n   It happened very suddenly. The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\\'s turban straight into Harry\\'s eyes-and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry\\'s forehead.\\n   \"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.\\n   \"Tut, tut-fame clearly isn\\'t everything.\"\\n   He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.\\n   There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\\n   \"Malfoy\\'s got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\\n   Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\\n   \"Let\\'s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\"\\n   I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\\n   Investigations continue into the break in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\n   Hagrid\\n   Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\\n   \"Well, my gran brought me up and she\\'s a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me-he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned-but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced-all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here-they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\"\\n   Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville\\'s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\\n   \"You\\'d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\\'ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\\'re nearly there. You haven\\'t been fighting, have you? You\\'ll be in trouble before we even get there!\"\\n   \"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\\'t you all copying that down?\"\\n   There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said,\"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\"\\n   Things didn\\'t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\\'s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\\'s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\\n   \"Is he-a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly.\\n   \"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\\n   \"Thought you wouldn\\'t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\\', but did Snape expect him to remember everything inOne Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\\n   Snape was still ignoring Hermione\\'s quivering hand.\\n   \"What the-?\"\\n   He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\\n   \"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again. \"The Bloody Baron\\'s the only one who can control him, he won\\'t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\"\\n   At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.\\n   \"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\\n   \"RAVENCLAW!\"\\n   The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\n   \"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\\'s imagination, after all he\\'d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He hadalways been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\\n   \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\"\\n   Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\\n   Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\\n   \"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\\'s looking so nervous, that\\'s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\\'t want to-everyone knows he\\'s after Quirrell\\'s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\"\\n   Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\\'s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from theDaily Prophet:\\n   Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron-Ron leapt forward, but before he\\'d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\\n   Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle\\'s knuckle-Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\\'d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\\n   \"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\"\\n   A voice echoed through the train:\"We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\\' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\"\\n   Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\n   It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\\'t simply open on to the heavens.\\n   Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\\'t mentioned the date.\\n   \"Hang on,\" he said.\"Back, Fang.\"\\n   He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn\\'t remember the dream at all.\\n   9. THE MIDNIGHT DUEL\\n   Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper,\"It\\'s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it inHogwarts, A History.\"\\n   It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\\n   At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\\n   \"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves-show yourself!\"\\n   A pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause-\\n   \"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break in happened on my birthday! It might\\'ve been happening while we were there!\"\\n   There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\\'t meet Harry\\'s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again.The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\\n   As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\\n   \"I\\'ve heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\\'d been bewitched. My dad doesn\\'t believe it. He says Malfoy\\'s father didn\\'t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to Hermione. \"Can we help you with something?\"\\n   \"You\\'ve met Malfoy before?\"\\n   Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\\n   \"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\\n   7. THE SORTING HAT\\n   The door swung open at once. A tall, black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\\'s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\\n   \"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the endof the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\\n   \"The firs\\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.\\n   \"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, \"Can\\'t you-?\"\\n   \"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you-you\\'re Nearly Headless Nick!\"\\n   \"I\\'d be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you\\'re a bit politer you\\'ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\\'t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\\'ll rub off on you.\"\\n   Dear Harry,\\n   I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\\n   Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\\n   8. THE POTIONS MASTER\\n   \"Think my name\\'s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\"\\n   Hedwig hadn\\'t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\\'s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\\n   Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\\'s, but they had none of Hagrid\\'s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\\n   \"You don\\'t know that you\\'ll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy\\'s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\\'s all talk.\"\\n   Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed,\"SLYTHERIN!\"\\n   Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing-noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth-and the hat began to sing:\"Oh, you may not think I\\'m pretty,But don\\'t judge on what you see,I\\'ll eat myself if you can findA smarter hat than me.You can keep your bowlers black,Your top hats sleek and tall,For I\\'m the Hogwarts Sorting HatAnd I can cap them all.There\\'s nothing hidden in your headThe Sorting Hat can\\'t see,So try me on and I will tell youWhere you ought to be.You might belong in Gryffindor,Where dwell the brave at heart,Their daring, nerve, and chivalrySet Gryffindors apart;You might belong in Hufflepuff,Where they are just and loyal,Those patient Hufflepuffs are trueAnd unafraid of toil;Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,If you\\'ve a ready mind,Where those of wit and learning,Will always find their kind;Or perhaps in SlytherinYou\\'ll make your real friends,Those cunning folk use any meansTo achieve their ends.So put me on! Don\\'t be afraid!And don\\'t get in a flap!You\\'re in safe hands (though I have none)For I\\'m a Thinking Cap!\"\\n   The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\\n   \"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\"\\n   Harry\\'s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy,ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\\n   The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\\'d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\\n   \"The Harry Potter?\"\\n   The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\\n   \"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you know.\"\\n   \"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It\\'s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\\'re not allowed to go somewhere-the forest\\'s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\"\\n   \"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\\'s freckles. \"I spent half me life chasin\\' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\"\\n   The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\\'s knee and drooled all over his robes.\\n   Harry borrowed Ron\\'s quill, scribbledYes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\n   Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\\n   Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\\'s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\\'s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\\n   \"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly.\\n   Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\\n   \"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"\\n   \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\\n   \"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\\'s twin brothers catcalling.\\n   \"But he seemed to reallyhate me.\"\\n   \"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\\n   \"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\"\\n   He turned back to Harry.\"You\\'ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\\'t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\"\\n   He ignored Hermione\\'s hand.\\n   \"Likethis,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said,\"So-new Gryffindors! I hope you\\'re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\\'s becoming almost unbearable-he\\'s the Slytherin ghost.\"\\n   Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard\\'s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\\'t have let it in the house.\\n   More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\\'t a dunderhead.\\n   \"Potter, Harry!\"\\n   As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\\'s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\\'d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week-why did Snape hate him so much?\\n   \"Did you see his face?\"\\n   \"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"\\n   There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\\n   \"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n   \"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"\\n   At three thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\\n   The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\\n   Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\\n   \"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.\\n   \"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"\\n   Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\\n   \"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\"\\n   Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\\'s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\\'d whisk off for Filch, who\\'d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\\n   As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they\\'d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\\'d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\\'t want to tell Harry?\\n   A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\\n   \"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\\n   Both Harry and Ron stood up.\\n   \"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would you mind leaving while we change?\"\\n   \"An\\' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\\'d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\\'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\\'t get rid of her-Fitch puts her up to it.\"\\n   Harry was going to ask Ron if he\\'d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\\n   Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\n   Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\\'s name.\\n   \"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"\\n   The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\\'s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hangingtapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\\n   A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\\'s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\\n   \"So we\\'ve just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I\\'ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"\\n   Harry told Hagrid about Snape\\'s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\n   \"But we don\\'t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\\'ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\"\\n   Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\\n   \"C\\'mon, follow me-any more firs\\' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\\' years follow me!\"\\n   Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\\n   \"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word-like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\\'t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death-if you aren\\'t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"\\n   Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\\'d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\\n   Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\\n   \"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron\\'ll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy.\\n   Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase-they were obviously in one of the towers-they found their beds at last: five four posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\\n   \"HUFFLEPUFF!\"\\n   Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide.\"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\\n   \"Great food, isn\\'t it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \"Getoff, Scabbers! He\\'s chewing my sheets.\"\\n   Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\\'t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\\'t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\\'t have much of a head start.\\n   GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\n   It happened very suddenly. The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\\'s turban straight into Harry\\'s eyes-and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry\\'s forehead.\\n   \"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.\\n   \"Tut, tut-fame clearly isn\\'t everything.\"\\n   He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.\\n   There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\\n   \"Malfoy\\'s got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\\n   Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\\n   \"Let\\'s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\"\\n   I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\\n   Investigations continue into the break in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\n   Hagrid\\n   Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\\n   \"Well, my gran brought me up and she\\'s a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me-he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned-but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced-all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here-they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\"\\n   Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville\\'s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\\n   \"You\\'d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\\'ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\\'re nearly there. You haven\\'t been fighting, have you? You\\'ll be in trouble before we even get there!\"\\n   \"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\\'t you all copying that down?\"\\n   There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said,\"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\"\\n   Things didn\\'t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\\'s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\\'s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\\n   \"Is he-a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly.\\n   \"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\\n   \"Thought you wouldn\\'t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\\', but did Snape expect him to remember everything inOne Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\\n   Snape was still ignoring Hermione\\'s quivering hand.\\n   \"What the-?\"\\n   He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\\n   \"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again. \"The Bloody Baron\\'s the only one who can control him, he won\\'t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\"\\n   At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.\\n   \"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\\n   \"RAVENCLAW!\"\\n   The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\n   \"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\\'s imagination, after all he\\'d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He hadalways been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\\n   \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\"\\n   Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\\n   Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\\n   \"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\\'s looking so nervous, that\\'s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\\'t want to-everyone knows he\\'s after Quirrell\\'s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\"\\n   Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\\'s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from theDaily Prophet:\\n   Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron-Ron leapt forward, but before he\\'d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\\n   Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle\\'s knuckle-Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\\'d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\\n   \"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\"\\n   A voice echoed through the train:\"We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\\' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\"\\n   Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\n   It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\\'t simply open on to the heavens.\\n   Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\\'t mentioned the date.\\n   \"Hang on,\" he said.\"Back, Fang.\"\\n   He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn\\'t remember the dream at all.\\n   9. THE MIDNIGHT DUEL\\n   Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper,\"It\\'s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it inHogwarts, A History.\"\\n   It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\\n   At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\\n   \"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves-show yourself!\"\\n   A pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause-\\n   \"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break in happened on my birthday! It might\\'ve been happening while we were there!\"\\n   There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\\'t meet Harry\\'s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again.The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\\n   As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\\n   \"I\\'ve heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\\'d been bewitched. My dad doesn\\'t believe it. He says Malfoy\\'s father didn\\'t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to Hermione. \"Can we help you with something?\"\\n   \"You\\'ve met Malfoy before?\"\\n   Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\\n   \"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\\n   7. THE SORTING HAT\\n   The door swung open at once. A tall, black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\\'s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\\n   \"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the endof the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\\n   \"The firs\\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.\\n   \"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, \"Can\\'t you-?\"\\n   \"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you-you\\'re Nearly Headless Nick!\"\\n   \"I\\'d be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you\\'re a bit politer you\\'ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\\'t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\\'ll rub off on you.\"\\n   Dear Harry,\\n   I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\\n   Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\\n   8. THE POTIONS MASTER\\n   \"Think my name\\'s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\"\\n   Hedwig hadn\\'t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\\'s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\\n   Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\\'s, but they had none of Hagrid\\'s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\\n   \"You don\\'t know that you\\'ll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy\\'s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\\'s all talk.\"\\n   Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed,\"SLYTHERIN!\"\\n   Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing-noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth-and the hat began to sing:\"Oh, you may not think I\\'m pretty,But don\\'t judge on what you see,I\\'ll eat myself if you can findA smarter hat than me.You can keep your bowlers black,Your top hats sleek and tall,For I\\'m the Hogwarts Sorting HatAnd I can cap them all.There\\'s nothing hidden in your headThe Sorting Hat can\\'t see,So try me on and I will tell youWhere you ought to be.You might belong in Gryffindor,Where dwell the brave at heart,Their daring, nerve, and chivalrySet Gryffindors apart;You might belong in Hufflepuff,Where they are just and loyal,Those patient Hufflepuffs are trueAnd unafraid of toil;Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,If you\\'ve a ready mind,Where those of wit and learning,Will always find their kind;Or perhaps in SlytherinYou\\'ll make your real friends,Those cunning folk use any meansTo achieve their ends.So put me on! Don\\'t be afraid!And don\\'t get in a flap!You\\'re in safe hands (though I have none)For I\\'m a Thinking Cap!\"\\n   The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\\n   \"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\"\\n   Harry\\'s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy,ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\\n   The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\\'d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\\n   \"The Harry Potter?\"\\n   The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\\n   \"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you know.\"\\n   \"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It\\'s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\\'re not allowed to go somewhere-the forest\\'s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\"\\n   \"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\\'s freckles. \"I spent half me life chasin\\' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\"\\n   The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\\'s knee and drooled all over his robes.\\n   Harry borrowed Ron\\'s quill, scribbledYes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\n   Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\\n   Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\\'s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\\'s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\\n   \"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly.\\n   Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\\n   \"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"\\n   \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\\n   \"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\\'s twin brothers catcalling.\\n   \"But he seemed to reallyhate me.\"\\n   \"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\\n   \"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\"\\n   He turned back to Harry.\"You\\'ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\\'t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\"\\n   He ignored Hermione\\'s hand.\\n   \"Likethis,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said,\"So-new Gryffindors! I hope you\\'re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\\'s becoming almost unbearable-he\\'s the Slytherin ghost.\"\\n   Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard\\'s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\\'t have let it in the house.\\n   More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\\'t a dunderhead.\\n   \"Potter, Harry!\"\\n   As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\\'s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\\'d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week-why did Snape hate him so much?\\n   \"Did you see his face?\"\\n   \"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"\\n   There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\\n   \"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n   \"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"\\n   At three thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\\n   The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\\n   Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\\n   \"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.\\n   \"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"\\n   Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\\n   \"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\"\\n   Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\\'s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\\'d whisk off for Filch, who\\'d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\\n   As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they\\'d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\\'d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\\'t want to tell Harry?\\n   A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\\n   \"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\\n   Both Harry and Ron stood up.\\n   \"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would you mind leaving while we change?\"\\n   \"An\\' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\\'d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\\'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\\'t get rid of her-Fitch puts her up to it.\"\\n   Harry was going to ask Ron if he\\'d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\\n   Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\n   Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\\'s name.\\n   \"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"\\n   The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\\'s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and p\\n   \"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\\'s face. \"And it\\'s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\\'ve got it,\" he added.\\n   Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\\'s obvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it\\'s true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn\\'t stolen Neville\\'s Remembrall I wouln\\'t be on the team...\"\\n   \"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must\\'ve noticed she\\'s got no friends.\"\\n   Hermione didn\\'t turn up for the next class and wasn\\'t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\\' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\\n   A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start of term banquet.\\n   Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\\'s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll-in the dungeons-thought you ought to know.\"\\n   He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\\n   There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore\\'s wand to bring silence.\\n   \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following-they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going-they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.\\n   \"I thought you weren\\'t speaking to us?\" said Harry.\\n   \"Yes, don\\'t stop now,\" said Ron, \"it\\'s doing us so much good.\"\\n   Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.\\n   Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\\'d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n   \"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\'s bedspread.\\n   Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\\n   As seven o\\'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He\\'d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\\n   Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling-he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\\n   \"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\\n   \"Don\\'t leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don\\'t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\\'s been past twice already.\"\\n   Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.\\n   \"In here.\"\\n   Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\\n   \"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\\n   Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.\\n   \"What\\'s he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn\\'t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\"\\n   \"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\\'s why you have two Beaters on each team-the Weasley twins are ours-it\\'s their job to protect their side fromthe Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So-think you\\'ve got all that?\"\\n   \"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\\n   \"I\\'m coming with you,\" she said.\\n   \"You are not.\"\\n   \"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"\\n   The other Slytherins joined in.\\n   \"Shut up, Peeves-please-you\\'ll get us thrown out.\"\\n   Peeves cackled.\\n   \"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\\'ll get caughty.\"\\n   \"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly.\\n   \"That\\'senough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\"\\n   Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\\'s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\\'s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\\'d done it. He hadn\\'t even lasted two weeks. He\\'d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\\n   Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn\\'t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\\'s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\\'s bag.\\n   Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.\\n   \"Excuse me.\"\\n   They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\\n   \"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\\n   Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down-next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball-wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching-he stretched out his hand-a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\\n   \"Half past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we\\'d better go.\"\\n   They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them,\"I can\\'t believe you\\'re going to do this, Harry.\"\\n   A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.\\n   \"You!\" said Ron furiously.\"Go back to bed!\"\\n   \"I couldn\\'t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying-\"\\n   \"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy-it\\'s all right, up you get.\"\\n   She turned to the rest of the class.\\n   \"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.\\n   \"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood-I\\'ve found you a Seeker.\"\\n   Wood\\'s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\\n   \"Be quiet, Miss Patil.\"\\n   \"Can you smell something?\"\\n   Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\\n   And then they heard it-a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed-at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\\n   It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\\n   The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\\n   \"They\\'re in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding.\"\\n   \"This,\" said Wood,\"is the Golden Snitch, and it\\'s the most important ball of the lot. It\\'s very hard to catch because it\\'s so fast and difficult to see. It\\'s the Seeker\\'s job to catch it. You\\'ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\\'s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\\'s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages-I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.\\n   \"Well, that\\'s it-any questions?\"\\n   Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.\\n   \"We won\\'t practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"it\\'s too dark, we might lose it. Let\\'s try you out with a few of these.\"\\n   He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\\n   Harry didn\\'t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\\'t carry on.\\n   \"That\\'s a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You\\'ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\\'t allowed them.\"\\n   Ron couldn\\'t resist it.\\n   \"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password\\'s \\'Pig snout\\' but it won\\'t help you now, the Fat Lady\\'s gone off somewhere.\"\\n   \"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy-he\\'s a prefect, he\\'d put a stop to this.\"\\n   Harry couldn\\'t believe anyone could be so interfering.\\n   \"Crabbe,\" he said. \"Midnight all right? We\\'ll meet you in the trophy room; that\\'s always unlocked.\"\\n   When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.\"What is a wizard\\'s duel?\" said Harry. \"And what do you mean, you\\'re my second?\"\\n   \"Well, a second\\'s there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\\'s face, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\\'ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\"\\n   \"Anyway, we\\'ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\\'s found a new secret passageway out of the school.\"\\n   \"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered.\\n   \"-unless they crack my head open.\"\\n   \"Don\\'t youcare about Gryffindor, do youonly care about yourselves,I don\\'t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\\'ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\"\\n   \"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously.\\n   \"-a century,\" said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \"Wood told me.\"\\n   Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\\n   \"I tell you, we\\'re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\" said Fred. \"We haven\\'t won since Charlie left, but this year\\'s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\"\\n   \"Are you serious, Professor?\"\\n   \"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you\\'re on the train home tomorrow, you\\'re so-\"\\n   But what they were, they didn\\'t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.\\n   \"Now, don\\'t forget that nice wrist movement we\\'ve been practicing!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too-never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \\'s\\' instead of \\'f\\' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\"\\n   It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it-Harry had to put it out with his hat.\\n   Ron, at the next table, wasn\\'t having much more luck.\\n   \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.\\n   \"You\\'re saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It\\'s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the\\'gar\\' nice and long.\"\\n   \"You do it, then, if you\\'re so clever,\" Ron snarled.\\n   Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,\"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\\n   Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.\\n   \"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\\n   Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\\n   \"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger.\"Madam Hooch told us not to move-you\\'ll get us all into trouble.\"\\n   Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he\\'d found something he could do without being taught-this was easy, this waswonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\\n   He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.\\n   \"Give ithere!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\\'t been lying, hecould fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called,\"Come and get it, Potter!\"\\n   Harry grabbed his broom.\\n   \"No, we don\\'t mind,\" he said. \"You\\'d think we dragged her along, wouldn\\'t you.\"\\n   But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide-except perhaps Hogwarts.\\n   It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\\n   10. HALLOWEEN\\n   Malfoy couldn\\'t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\\n   \"It\\'s no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"she\\'s a nightmare, honestly.\"\\n   Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face-and was startled to see that she was in tears.\\n   \"I think we\\'ve lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\\n   \"If either of you get us caught, I\\'ll never rest until I\\'ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\"\\n   Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.\\n   They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.\\n   Malfoy and Crabbe weren\\'t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\\n   \"Hey, Potter, come down!\"\\n   Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.\\n   \"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I\\'m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\\'ll be joining team practice three times a week.\"\\n   He opened the crate. Inside were four different sized balls.\\n   \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR-\"\\n   Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door-and it was locked.\\n   \"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.\\n   The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\\n   \"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\\'s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\"\\n   \"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested.\\n   \"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them. \"Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\"\\n   \"HARRY POTTER!\"\\n   His heart sank faster than he\\'d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\\n   \"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called.\\n   The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\\n   \"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle-twelve feet-twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and-\\n   WHAM-a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the Forbidden Forest and out of sight.\\n   Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\\n   \"But Malfoy-\"\\n   \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\" Harry recited. \"So-that\\'s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\\'t it?\"\\n   \"What\\'s basketball?\" said Wood curiously.\\n   \"Never-in all my time at Hogwarts-\"\\n   Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously,\"-howdare you-might have broken your neck-\"\\n   \"It\\'s either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.\\n   \"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\\n   \"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\"\\n   Percy was in his element.\\n   \"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\\n   \"It wasn\\'t his fault, Professor-\"\\n   \"Bet it\\'s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\"\\n   Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\\n   \"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood. \"Didn\\'t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\\'t have done it.\"\\n   Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\\n   \"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\"\\n   Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?\\n   But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth year boy who came out of Flitwick\\'s class looking confused.\\n   \"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.\\n   \"Say \\'please.\\'\"\\n   \"Don\\'t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers-I mean, they\\'re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"\\n   Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\\n   \"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry reeled off.\\n   \"Very good,\" said Wood.\\n   \"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly.\\n   \"Wood\\'s captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained.\\n   \"He\\'s late, maybe he\\'s chickened out,\" Ron whispered.\\n   Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn\\'t Malfoy.\\n   \"So I suppose you think that\\'s a reward for breaking rules?\" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\\'s hand.\\n   \"I want to hear you\\'re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\"\\n   Then she suddenly smiled.\\n   \"Your father would have been proud,\" she said. \"He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\"* * *\\n   \"You\\'rejoking.\"\\n   It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he\\'d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\\'d forgotten all about it.\\n   \"Shan\\'t say nothing if you don\\'t say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.\\n   \"And it\\'s really none of your business,\" said Harry.\\n   \"Good-well, look, Neville, we\\'ve got to be somewhere, we\\'ll see you later-\"\\n   \"Don\\'t mess with me, Peeves, nowwhere did they go?\"\\n   \"She doesn\\'t know about the troll.\"\\n   Ron bit his lip.\\n   \"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\\'s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered,\"Alohomora!\"\\n   The lock clicked and the door swung open-they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\\n   \"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\"\\n   \"Search me.\"\\n   Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\\'s fading footsteps.\\n   \"He\\'s just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \"Light-speedy-we\\'ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor-a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\\'d say.\"\\n   \"I start training next week,\" said Harry. \"Only don\\'t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\"\\n   Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\\n   \"Well done,\" said George in a low voice. \"Wood told us. We\\'re on the team too-Beaters.\"\\n   \"I think I\\'ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find-how about-up a tree?\"\\n   \"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.\\n   Malfoy smiled nastily.\\n   \"I think she heard you.\"\\n   \"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.\\n   At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry\\'s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air-it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\\n   \"Seeker?\" he said.\"But first yearsnever-you must be the youngest house player in about-\"\\n   \"-and youmustn\\'t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you\\'ll lose Gryffindor if you\\'re caught, and you\\'re bound to be. It\\'s really very selfish of you.\"\\n   \"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\"\\n   \"UP!\" everyone shouted.\\n   Harry\\'s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\\'s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\\'s hadn\\'t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\\'s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\\n   Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\\'d been doing it wrong for years.\\n   \"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around. \"I\\'m his second, who\\'s yours?\"\\n   Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\\n   \"D\\'you think I\\'m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I\\'ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\"\\n   \"You\\'ve got some nerve-\" said Ron loudly.\\n   \"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\"\\n   It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch\\'s voice. Neville\\'s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\\n   \"This ball\\'s called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\"\\n   \"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn\\'t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\"\\n   \"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\\'ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say \\'Quidditch.\\' Come on, dear.\"\\n   Neville, his face tear streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\\n   No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\\n   \"Don\\'t ask me, they\\'re supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"\\n   They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\\'s arm.\\n   \"I-told-you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \"I-told-you.\"\\n   \"We\\'ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as possible.\"\\n   \"Mrs. Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\\n   It wasn\\'t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\\n   \"That Quidditch cup\\'ll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\\'t gone off chasing dragons.\"\\n   Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he\\'d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\\n   On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they\\'d seen him make Neville\\'s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry\\'s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard totell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\\'t spoken to either of them since the day Harry\\'s broomstick had arrived.\\n   \"Now, there\\'s another player on each side who\\'s called the Keeper. I\\'m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\"\\n   \"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.\\n   \"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We\\'re done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\\'s shouts.\\n   \"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger\\'s done it!\"\\n   Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\\n   \"It\\'s not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it\\'s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you\\'ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they\\'re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\"\\n   \"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\\'t afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\"\\n   Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\\'s elbow.\\n   \"Not if you don\\'t give us away, Peeves, please.\"\\n   \"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.\\n   \"Or both,\" said Harry.\\n   But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn\\'t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\\n   Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\\n   Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\\n   As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\\'s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\\n   Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\\n   DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\\n   It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\\'t want everybody knowing you\\'ve got a broomstick or they\\'ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\\'clock for your first training session.\\n   Professor McGonagall\\n   Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\\n   \"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\\'s face. \"And it\\'s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\\'ve got it,\" he added.\\n   Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\\'s obvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it\\'s true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn\\'t stolen Neville\\'s Remembrall I wouln\\'t be on the team...\"\\n   \"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must\\'ve noticed she\\'s got no friends.\"\\n   Hermione didn\\'t turn up for the next class and wasn\\'t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\\' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\\n   A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start of term banquet.\\n   Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\\'s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll-in the dungeons-thought you ought to know.\"\\n   He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\\n   There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore\\'s wand to bring silence.\\n   \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following-they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going-they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.\\n   \"I thought you weren\\'t speaking to us?\" said Harry.\\n   \"Yes, don\\'t stop now,\" said Ron, \"it\\'s doing us so much good.\"\\n   Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.\\n   Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\\'d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n   \"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\'s bedspread.\\n   Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\\n   As seven o\\'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He\\'d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\\n   Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling-he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\\n   \"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\\n   \"Don\\'t leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don\\'t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\\'s been past twice already.\"\\n   Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.\\n   \"In here.\"\\n   Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\\n   \"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\\n   Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.\\n   \"What\\'s he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn\\'t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\"\\n   \"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\\'s why you have two Beaters on each team-the Weasley twins are ours-it\\'s their job to protect their side fromthe Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So-think you\\'ve got all that?\"\\n   \"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\\n   \"I\\'m coming with you,\" she said.\\n   \"You are not.\"\\n   \"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"\\n   The other Slytherins joined in.\\n   \"Shut up, Peeves-please-you\\'ll get us thrown out.\"\\n   Peeves cackled.\\n   \"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\\'ll get caughty.\"\\n   \"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly.\\n   \"That\\'senough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\"\\n   Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\\'s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\\'s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\\'d done it. He hadn\\'t even lasted two weeks. He\\'d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\\n   Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn\\'t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\\'s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\\'s bag.\\n   Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.\\n   \"Excuse me.\"\\n   They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\\n   \"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\\n   Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down-next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball-wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching-he stretched out his hand-a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\\n   \"Half past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we\\'d better go.\"\\n   They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them,\"I can\\'t believe you\\'re going to do this, Harry.\"\\n   A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.\\n   \"You!\" said Ron furiously.\"Go back to bed!\"\\n   \"I couldn\\'t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying-\"\\n   \"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy-it\\'s all right, up you get.\"\\n   She turned to the rest of the class.\\n   \"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.\\n   \"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood-I\\'ve found you a Seeker.\"\\n   Wood\\'s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\\n   \"Be quiet, Miss Patil.\"\\n   \"Can you smell something?\"\\n   Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\\n   And then they heard it-a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed-at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\\n   It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like \\n   \"And she\\'s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\\'s, last year only a reserve-back to Johnson and-no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes-Flint flying like an eagle up there-he\\'s going to sc-no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle-that\\'s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and-OUCH-that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger-Quaffle taken by the Slytherins-that\\'s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\\'s blocked by a second Bludger-sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\\'t tell which-nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead andoff she goes-she\\'s really flying-dodges a speeding Bludger-the goal posts are ahead-come on, now, Angelina-Keeper Bletchley dives-misses-GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\"\\n   Hagrid dropped the teapot.\\n   \"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked.\\n   \"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had said. \"We don\\'t want you attacked before you have to be.\"\\n   When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys\\' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\\n   \"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\\'m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\"\\n   It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.\\n   \"No-he wouldn\\'t,\" she said. \"I know he\\'s not very nice, but he wouldn\\'t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\"\\n   \"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said.\\n   \"Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors.\\n   Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\\n   \"Now, don\\'t ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"That\\'s top secret, that is.\"\\n   \"But this isn\\'t soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him.\\n   Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\\'t know which was worse-people telling him he\\'d be brilliant or people telling him they\\'d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\\n   It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\\n   Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\\'s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\\'t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape\\'s eye. He limped over. He hadn\\'t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.\\n   \"Who\\'s there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.\\n   \"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree-put it in the far corner, would you?\"\\n   The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\\n   \"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I\\'ve got some presents!\"\\n   \"What is it?\"\\n   Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it wasTo Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it-it sounded a bit like an owl.\\n   A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn\\'t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\\'s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\\n   Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\\n   There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.\\n   \"I\\'ll get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\\'s back, \"one of these days, I\\'ll get him-\"\\n   \"I just wondered if I could have my book back.\"\\n   \"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind you, wedid save her.\"\\n   \"Shut up, you two,\" said Wood. \"This is the best team Gryffindor\\'s had in years. We\\'re going to win. I know it.\"\\n   He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.\\n   Use it well.\\n   Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\\'s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.\\n   \"Did you get it?\" Ron asked as Harry joined them. \"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n   It had been Harry\\'s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.\\n   Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.\\n   \"Budge up there, move along.\"\\n   \"Harry\\'s is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry\\'s sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you\\'re not family.\"\\n   \"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoy\\'s cold drawl from behind them. \"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose-that hut of Hagrid\\'s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\\'s used to.\"\\n   Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?\\n   \"Is it-dead?\"\\n   \"I don\\'t want anything.\"\\n   \"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\\n   They had indeed been searching books for Flamel\\'s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\\'t inGreat Wizards of the Twentieth Century, orNotable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, fromImportant Modern Magical Discoveries, andA Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\\n   Hermione\\'s eyes were wide.\\n   \"Nope,\" said Ron. \"Harry hasn\\'t had much to do yet.\"\\n   \"Leave it to me.\"\\n   Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\\'t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\\n   \"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.\\n   \"Youwhat?\" Hagrid looked shocked.\"Listen here-I\\'ve told yeh-drop it. It\\'s nothin\\' to you what that dog\\'s guardin\\'.\"\\n   \"We know Oliver\\'s speech by heart,\" Fred told Harry, \"we were on the team last year.\"\\n   \"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the-wait a moment-was that the Snitch?\"\\n   A second, very small parcel contained a note.\\n   We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.\\n   The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\\'s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\"How will you learn?\"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.\\n   Harry felt terrible. In an hour\\'s time he\\'d be walking onto the field.\\n   \"He didn\\'tcatch it, he nearlyswallowed it,\" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference-Harry hadn\\'t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results-Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\\'s hut, with Ron and Hermione.\\n   \"It\\'s an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I\\'m sure it is-try it on.\"\\n   Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but-\\n   \"Pig snout,\" they said and entered.\\n   The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.\\n   \"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they\\'re not wanted at home.\"\\n   He wiped it on the troll\\'s trousers.\\n   After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they\\'d stolen his prefect badge.\\n   It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts-he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time out-and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn\\'t turn it. He couldn\\'t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.\\n   Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\\n   Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\\n   \"You\\'d better get out, then. Go on-out!\"\\n   Wishing he\\'d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\\'d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she\\'d be able to tell them, but they couldn\\'t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\\n   Harry was faster than Higgs-he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead-he put on an extra spurt of speed-\\n   WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below-Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\\'s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.\\n   \"GET OUT!OUT!\"\\n   Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.\\n   \"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\"\\n   Lee was still commentating.\\n   \"So why did he just try to kill Harry?\" cried Hermione.\\n   The club flew suddenly out of the troll\\'s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over-and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\\'s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\\n   Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce-and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\\'t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral\\'s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\\'s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a jokeProfessor Flitwick had just read him.\\n   Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop-a high, petrified scream-and it was coming from the chamber they\\'d just chained up.\\n   \"Oh, we\\'re not working,\" Harry told him brightly. \"Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\\'ve been trying to find out who he is.\"\\n   11. QUIDDITCH\\n   At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\\'s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\\n   \"What are you looking for, boy?\"\\n   \"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?\\n   But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\\'t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\\n   12. THE MIRROR OF ERISED\\n   Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling,\"Send him off, ref! Red card!\"\\n   \"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\\'s.\\n   Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\\'t trust him at all. He wasn\\'t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don\\'t send me there, can\\'t you see his knight? Sendhim, we can afford to losehim.\"\\n   Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork-bread, English muffins, marshmallows-and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\\'t work.\\n   Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It saidPotter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.\\n   No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape\\'s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\\n   \"I don\\'t think so,\" said Harry, \"I think it\\'s just been knocked out.\"\\n   He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.\\n   \"Why aren\\'t you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it on, they\\'re lovely and warm.\"\\n   \"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape.\"\\n   \"Come on, run,run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\\'t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.\\n   The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\\n   \"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\\'re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\"\\n   \"If they hadn\\'t found me, I\\'d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\\'t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\"\\n   Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\\'t have lost so badly if Percy hadn\\'t tried to help him so much.\\n   As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.\\n   The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry\\'s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\\n   \"Dunno, but I hope it\\'s really hurting him,\" said Ron bitterly.\\n   The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.\\n   Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\\'t new to them.\\n   \"What are you doing?\" moaned Ron, gray faced.\\n   \"I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\\'ve read all about them! You\\'ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\\'t blinking at all, I saw him!\"\\n   \"I\\'ve got the Snitch!\" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.\\n   \"He was provoked, Professor Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \"Malfoy was insultin\\' his family.\"\\n   \"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn\\'t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\\n   He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\\'d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\\n   It wasQuidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\\n   \"Merry Christmas!\"\\n   \"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.\\n   \"Neville, you can look!\" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid\\'s jacket for the last five minutes.\\n   Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\\'t sleep. He tried to empty his mind-he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours-but the expression on Snape\\'s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn\\'t easy to forget.\\n   The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\\n   Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\\n   \"JORDAN!\"\\n   \"Thanks, Seamus,\" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.\\n   Christmas was coming. One morning in mid December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.\\n   On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\\n   \"Miss Granger!\"\\n   Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand-not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head:\"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\\n   The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said\"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates.\\n   By eleven o\\'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.\\n   Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.\\n   \"Blasted thing,\" Snape was saying. \"How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\"\\n   Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn\\'t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\\'t surprising they\\'d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\\n   Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry\\'s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\\n   When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris\\'s Christmas dinner.\\n   Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n   Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.\\n   Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.\\n   \"And women,\" Wood agreed. \"This is it.\"\\n   \"The library?\" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \"Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\\'t yeh?\"\\n   \"Okay, men,\" he said.\\n   \"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron. \"It\\'d be safe to ask them.\"\\n   \"WEASLEY!\"\\n   Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.\\n   \"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\"\\n   They hurried out of the chamber and didn\\'t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.\\n   \"Weird!\" he said,\"What a shape! This ismoney?\"\\n   \"You haven\\'t got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she thinks you don\\'t forget your name. But we\\'re not stupid-we know we\\'re called Gred and Forge.\"\\n   \"What\\'s that you\\'ve got there, Potter?\"\\n   Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\\n   \"Sorry, Professor.\"\\n   The afternoon\\'s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.\\n   \"I mean, after that open and revolting foul-\"\\n   \"Just a bit of toast,\" wheedled Hermione.\\n   \"I\\'m sayin\\' nothin\\',\" said Hagrid flatly.\\n   \"Just one,\" said Hermione. \"And that reminds me-Harry, Ron, we\\'ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\"\\n   \"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\\n   \"Itis! Look down!\"\\n   Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.\\n   \"It\\'s the girls\\' bathroom!\" Harry gasped.\\n   \"Hey, look-Harry\\'s got a Weasley sweater, too!\"\\n   Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.\\n   \"But Snape\\'s trying tosteal it.\"\\n   \"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn\\'t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do somethin\\' like that?\"\\n   He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\\'s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\\n   \"Very safe, as they\\'re both dentists,\" said Hermione.\\n   Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\\n   \"POTTER!\"\\n   So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.\\n   \"Aha!\" said Harry, \"so there\\'s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\"\\n   Hagrid, however, was on Dean\\'s side.\\n   \"Unless you\\'d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added. \"We must\\'ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\\'t find him anywhere-just give us a hint-I know I\\'ve read his name somewhere.\"\\n   \"I\\'m tellin\\' yeh, yer wrong!\" said Hagrid hotly. \"I don\\' know why Harry\\'s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\\' try an\\' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh-yer meddlin\\' in things that don\\' concern yeh. It\\'s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\\' you forget what it\\'s guardin\\', that\\'s between Professor Dumbledore an\\' Nicolas Flamel-\"\\n   \"All right there, Harry?\" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.\\n   \"Slytherin in possession-Flint with the Quaffle-passes Spinnet-passes Bell-hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose-only joking, Professor-Slytherins score-A no...\"\\n   The Weasley twins\\' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.\\n   \"And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor-what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too-\"\\n   \"Jordan!\" growled Professor McGonagall.\\n   \"I think I know who that one\\'s from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn\\'t expect any presents and-oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she\\'s made you a Weasley sweater.\"\\n   Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\\n   Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn\\'t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape\\'s robes.\\n   It was Hermione who spoke first.\\n   \"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\\'t take his eyes off you.\"\\n   \"She might not have needed saving if we hadn\\'t locked the thing in with her,\" Harry reminded him.\\n   They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\\n   \"Please, Professor McGonagall-they were looking for me.\"\\n   \"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I\\'m very disappointed in you. If you\\'re not hurt at all, you\\'d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\"\\n   Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn\\'t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he\\'d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\n   \"What are you talking about, Dean?\" said Ron.\\n   \"Right. It\\'s time. Good luck, all of you.\"\\n   Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\\n   It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He\\'d never felt anything like that.\\n   It is time it was returned to you.\\n   Use it well.\\n   A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.\\n   Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll\\'s neck from behind. The troll couldn\\'t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry\\'s wand had still been in his hand when he\\'d jumped-it had gone straight up one of the troll\\'s nostrils.\\n   In a low whisper, Harry told them what he\\'d seen.\\n   \"You will keep looking while I\\'m away, won\\'t you?\" said Hermione. \"And send me an owl if you find anything.\"\\n   \"And you\\'re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George. \"Christmas is a time for family.\"\\n   They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.\\n   Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\\n   \"Five, you mean, once she\\'s taken off Hermione\\'s.\"\\n   \"Hagrid!\"\\n   Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\\n   \"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\\'s all,\" said Hermione.\\n   \"Urgh-troll boogers.\"\\n   Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.\\n   \"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\" Seamus whispered.\\n   \"Come on, Hermione,\" Ron muttered desperately.\\n   Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\\n   \"I\\'d giveanything for one of these,\" he said.\"Anything. What\\'s the matter?\"\\n   \"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\" she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of hiseye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.\\n   \"Nah, I\\'m all right, thanks, Ron.\"\\n   \"Yeah-he\\'s mine-bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las\\' year-I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the-\"\\n   \"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle-so who sent these?\"\\n   \"I went looking for the troll because I-I thought I could deal with it on my own-you know, because I\\'ve read all about them.\"\\n   Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.\\n   \"He\\'s just made that rule up,\" Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. \"Wonder what\\'s wrong with his leg?\"\\n   \"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and mine\\'salways maroon.\"\\n   \"The big one,\" said Fred Weasley.\\n   \"There\\'s a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\"\\n   Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.\\n   Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick-he hit the field on all fours-coughed-and something gold fell into his hand.\\n   \"I\\'ve heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\\'d gotten from Hermione. \"If that\\'s what I think it is-they\\'re really rare, andreally valuable.\"\\n   \"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \"You\\'re lucky you weren\\'t killed. Why aren\\'t you in your dormitory?\"\\n   Snape\\'s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.\\n   \"I knew it,\" Hermione gasped, \"Snape-look.\"\\n   Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back-his father\\'s cloak-he felt that this time-the first time-he wanted to use it alone.\\n   He glared at them all as if to say,\"Or else.\"\\n   \"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid again. \"Snape\\'s a Hogwarts teacher, he\\'d do nothin\\' of the sort.\"\\n   \"So-after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating-\"\\n   \"Jordan, I\\'m warning you-\"\\n   \"And she\\'s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\\'s, last year only a reserve-back to Johnson and-no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes-Flint flying like an eagle up there-he\\'s going to sc-no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle-that\\'s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and-OUCH-that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger-Quaffle taken by the Slytherins-that\\'s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\\'s blocked by a second Bludger-sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\\'t tell which-nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead andoff she goes-she\\'s really flying-dodges a speeding Bludger-the goal posts are ahead-come on, now, Angelina-Keeper Bletchley dives-misses-GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\"\\n   Hagrid dropped the teapot.\\n   \"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked.\\n   \"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had said. \"We don\\'t want you attacked before you have to be.\"\\n   When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys\\' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\\n   \"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\\'m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\"\\n   It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.\\n   \"No-he wouldn\\'t,\" she said. \"I know he\\'s not very nice, but he wouldn\\'t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\"\\n   \"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said.\\n   \"Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors.\\n   Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\\n   \"Now, don\\'t ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"That\\'s top secret, that is.\"\\n   \"But this isn\\'t soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him.\\n   Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\\'t know which was worse-people telling him he\\'d be brilliant or people telling him they\\'d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\\n   It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\\n   Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\\'s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\\'t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape\\'s eye. He limped over. He hadn\\'t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.\\n   \"Who\\'s there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.\\n   \"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree-put it in the far corner, would you?\"\\n   The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\\n   \"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I\\'ve got some presents!\"\\n   \"What is it?\"\\n   Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it wasTo Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it-it sounded a bit like an owl.\\n   A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn\\'t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\\'s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\\n   Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\\n   There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.\\n   \"I\\'ll get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\\'s back, \"one of these days, I\\'ll get him-\"\\n   \"I just wondered if I could have my book back.\"\\n   \"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind you, wedid save her.\"\\n   \"Shut up, you two,\" said Wood. \"This is the best team Gryffindor\\'s had in years. We\\'re going to win. I know it.\"\\n   He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.\\n   Use it well.\\n   Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\\'s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.\\n   \"Did you get it?\" Ron asked as Harry joined them. \"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n   It had been Harry\\'s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.\\n   Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.\\n   \"Budge up there, move along.\"\\n   \"Harry\\'s is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry\\'s sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you\\'re not family.\"\\n   \"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoy\\'s cold drawl from behind them. \"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose-that hut of Hagrid\\'s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\\'s used to.\"\\n   Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?\\n   \"Is it-dead?\"\\n   \"I don\\'t want anything.\"\\n   \"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\\n   They had indeed been searching books for Flamel\\'s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\\'t inGreat Wizards of the Twentieth Century, orNotable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, fromImportant Modern Magical Discoveries, andA Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\\n   Hermione\\'s eyes were wide.\\n   \"Nope,\" said Ron. \"Harry hasn\\'t had much to do yet.\"\\n   \"Leave it to me.\"\\n   Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\\'t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\\n   \"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.\\n   \"Youwhat?\" Hagrid looked shocked.\"Listen here-I\\'ve told yeh-drop it. It\\'s nothin\\' to you what that dog\\'s guardin\\'.\"\\n   \"We know Oliver\\'s speech by heart,\" Fred told Harry, \"we were on the team last year.\"\\n   \"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the-wait a moment-was that the Snitch?\"\\n   A second, very small parcel contained a note.\\n   We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.\\n   The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\\'s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\"How will you learn?\"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.\\n   Harry felt terrible. In an hour\\'s time he\\'d be walking onto the field.\\n   \"He didn\\'tcatch it, he nearlyswallowed it,\" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference-Harry hadn\\'t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results-Gryffindor had won by one h\\n   \"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\'ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\"\\n   \"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly.\\n   \"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\\'t you eating anything?\"\\n   Harry didn\\'t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\\'d found out about the Sorcerer\\'s Stone? Harry didn\\'t see how he could-yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\\n   Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.\\n   \"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\"\\n   \"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. \"Nice to see you haven\\'t been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent...\"\\n   So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\\n   \"Yeah-yer not still on abou\\' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helpedprotect the Stone, he\\'s not about ter steal it.\"\\n   Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they\\'d ever see him alive again. This wasn\\'t what you\\'d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\\'s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n   Ron didn\\'t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\\n   \"You know perfectly well what I mean.\"\\n   And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\\n   The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.\\n   \"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry-\"\\n   \"What?\"\\n   \"I can only see you.\"\\n   \"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...\"\\n   \"I can\\'t see anything.\"\\n   \"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He said he\\'d been looking for someone to practice that on.\"\\n   \"Hagrid\\'s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,\" said Harry.\\n   \"But there aren\\'t wild dragons inBritain?\" said Harry.\\n   \"Oh, I thought we\\'d keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy. \"Students aren\\'t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, after all.\"\\n   Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\\'t ever remember feeling happier. He\\'d really done something to be proud of now-no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\\n   Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\\n   \"You\\'re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\\'s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\"\\n   \"Don\\'t talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \"I need to concen-\" He caught sight of Harry\\'s face. \"What\\'s the matter with you? You look terrible.\"\\n   That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn\\'t meet anyone.\\n   As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\\n   \"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.\\n   Harry couldn\\'t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\\'t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\\n   \"B-b-but Severus, I-\"\\n   \"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\"\\n   \"You\\'re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren\\'t you, Hagrid?\" said Harry anxiously. \"And you wouldn\\'t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\"\\n   \"Now, don\\'t forget, it\\'sLocomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n   \"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\"\\n   \"Longbottom, if brains were gold you\\'d be poorer than Weasley, and that\\'s saying something.\"\\n   Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\\n   \"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\"\\n   Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn\\'t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they\\'d knock right into him-the cloak didn\\'t stop him from being solid.\\n   He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\\'t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\\'t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.\\n   \"You can come tonight, I\\'m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\"\\n   \"I\\'ll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they\\'d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget me not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\\n   He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\\n   It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\\n   \"It\\'ll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.\\n   A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry\\'s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure\\'s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner-what was going on?\\n   Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\\'t believe it. He\\'d done it-the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white faced and tight lipped-then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\\'s smiling face.\\n   \"Well, I don\\' s\\'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let\\'s see... he borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o\\' the teachers did enchantments... Professor Sprout-Professor Flitwick-Professor McGonagall-\" he ticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell-an\\' Dumbledore himself did somethin\\', o\\' course. Hang on, I\\'ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\"\\n   \"So we were right, itis the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, and Snape\\'s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy-and he said something about Quirrell\\'s \\'hocus pocus\\'-I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through-\"\\n   \"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\"\\n   \"I don\\'t need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\"\\n   Harry stared.\\n   \"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested.\\n   \"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game\\'s over! Harry\\'s won! We\\'ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\\n   Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything-except, it seemed, Quirrell\\'s spell and how to get past Fluffy.\\n   \"You\\'re worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\\'t it? And where\\'s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\"\\n   Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\\n   \"I-I don\\'t know what you-\"\\n   \"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\\n   How long he stood there, he didn\\'t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\\'t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\\'s face, whispered, \"I\\'ll come back,\" and hurried from the room.\\n   \"You don\\'t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step toward him.\\n   \"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\"\\n   Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\\'t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\\n   She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\\n   The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\\n   They didn\\'t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\\'t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\\'s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn\\'t be.\\n   He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\\'d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air-she and the others existed only in the mirror.\\n   Snape spat bitterly on the ground.\\n   Harry shook his head.\\n   \"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\\'d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\\n   At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\\'s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\\n   Except-\\n   \"So-yeh wanted to ask me somethin\\'?\"\\n   \"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\\'s been in the library Restricted Section.\"\\n   Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\\'d done it, he\\'d shown Snape...\\n   And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.\\n   George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\\n   \"Snape?\"\\n   \"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\\n   \"The what?\" said Harry and Ron.\\n   \"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn\\'t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\"\\n   It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.\\n   \"Someone was lookin\\' through the gap in the curtains-it\\'s a kid-he\\'s runnin\\' back up ter the school.\"\\n   Harry could have laughed out loud with relief-He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.\\n   Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they\\'d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn\\'t look as though he\\'d cracked yet.\\n   Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\\'s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.\\n   \"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\"\\n   They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\\'t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\\n   \"-I didn\\'t see you, sir.\"\\n   \"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That\\'s not ages, that\\'s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\"\\n   \"But what are you going to do with it when it\\'s hatched?\" said Hermione.\\n   \"Well, that\\'s something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can we have a window open? I\\'m boiling.\"\\n   \"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape-she didn\\'t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\\n   What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\\'s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\\n   \"I\\'m going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don\\'t, all the Slytherins will think I\\'m just too scared to face Snape. I\\'ll show them... it\\'ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\"\\n   \"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\"\\n   \"I can\\'t,\" said Harry. \"There isn\\'t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\\'t play at all.\"\\n   Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n   \"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these:Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\\'s Guide.\"\\n   \"Hagrid, you live in awooden house,\" she said.\\n   But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\\'t going to stop him.\\n   The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\\n   It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket-but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn\\'t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\\n   It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\\n   14. NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\\n   Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\\'s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\\n   \"It\\'s notmy fault,\" said Wood. \"We\\'ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\\'t got an excuse to pick on us.\"\\n   Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch...\\n   The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\\n   \"It-well-it shows me my family-\"\\n   \"And no wonder we couldn\\'t find Flamel in thatStudy of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron.\"He\\'s not exactly recent if he\\'s six hundred and sixty five, is he?\"\\n   The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\\n   \"Don\\'t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\\'s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\"\\n   \"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said Harry, \"about what\\'s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy-\"\\n   \"Say you\\'re ill,\" said Ron.\\n   \"Quick!\"\\n   Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.\\n   \"Don\\'t play,\" said Hermione at once.\\n   \"See you later, then,\" said Harry.\\n   Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face-he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\\n   \"What? Where?\"\\n   Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\\n   Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\\'d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\\n   \"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las\\' night. I was down in the village havin\\' a few drinks an\\' got into a game o\\' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\"\\n   \"Can you see all your family standing around you?\"\\n   \"No.\"\\n   \"Why not?\"\\n   \"I knew it! Iknew it!\"\\n   \"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\"\\n   When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\\'s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\\n   Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\\n   \"Wonder what it\\'s like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\\n   There have been many reports of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty eight).\\n   \"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \"Don\\' go shoutin\\' about it, what\\'s the matter with yeh?\"\\n   \"There\\'s no need to tell me I\\'m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\\'s already done that,\" Neville choked out.\\n   Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied,\"The Restricted Section? Well, they can\\'t be far, we\\'ll catch them.\"\\n   Harry stood up.\\n   \"Snape\\'s refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When\\'s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\\'s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\"\\n   The snow still hadn\\'t melted the next morning.\\n   \"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single handed! He\\'s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he\\'ll be all right-talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone\\'s waiting for you in the common room, we\\'re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\"\\n   \"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically,\"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone!\"\\n   Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren\\'t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon\\'s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.\\n   \"I\\'m freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let\\'s forget it and go back.\"\\n   \"No-I\\'m alone-but I\\'m different-I look older-and I\\'m head boy!\"\\n   \"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \"It must\\'ve cost you a fortune.\"\\n   \"Wonder how long Potter\\'s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\"\\n   Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.\\n   \"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\"\\n   \"I\\'m serious, Harry, don\\'t go.\"\\n   But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\\n   \"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\'ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\"\\n   \"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly.\\n   \"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\\'t you eating anything?\"\\n   Harry didn\\'t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry.

A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\\n   \"It\\'ll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.\\n   A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry\\'s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure\\'s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner-what was going on?\\n   Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\\'t believe it. He\\'d done it-the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white faced and tight lipped-then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\\'s smiling face.\\n   \"Well, I don\\' s\\'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let\\'s see... he borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o\\' the teachers did enchantments... Professor Sprout-Professor Flitwick-Professor McGonagall-\" he ticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell-an\\' Dumbledore himself did somethin\\', o\\' course. Hang on, I\\'ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\"\\n   \"So we were right, itis the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, and Snape\\'s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy-and he said something about Quirrell\\'s \\'hocus pocus\\'-I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through-\"\\n   \"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\"\\n   \"I don\\'t need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\"\\n   Harry stared.\\n   \"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested.\\n   \"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game\\'s over! Harry\\'s won! We\\'ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\\n   Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything-except, it seemed, Quirrell\\'s spell and how to get past Fluffy.\\n   \"You\\'re worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\\'t it? And where\\'s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\"\\n   Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\\n   \"I-I don\\'t know what you-\"\\n   \"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\\n   How long he stood there, he didn\\'t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\\'t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\\'s face, whispered, \"I\\'ll come back,\" and hurried from the room.\\n   \"You don\\'t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step toward him.\\n   \"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\"\\n   Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\\'t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\\n   She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\\n   The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\\n   They didn\\'t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\\'t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\\'s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn\\'t be.\\n   He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\\'d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air-she and the others existed only in the mirror.\\n   Snape spat bitterly on the ground.\\n   Harry shook his head.\\n   \"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\\'d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\\n   At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\\'s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\\n   Except-\\n   \"So-yeh wanted to ask me somethin\\'?\"\\n   \"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\\'s been in the library Restricted Section.\"\\n   Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\\'d done it, he\\'d shown Snape...\\n   And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.\\n   George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\\n   \"Snape?\"\\n   \"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\\n   \"The what?\" said Harry and Ron.\\n   \"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn\\'t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\"\\n   It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.\\n   \"Someone was lookin\\' through the gap in the curtains-it\\'s a kid-he\\'s runnin\\' back up ter the school.\"\\n   Harry could have laughed out loud with relief-He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.\\n   Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they\\'d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn\\'t look as though he\\'d cracked yet.\\n   Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\\'s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.\\n   \"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\"\\n   They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\\'t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\\n   \"-I didn\\'t see you, sir.\"\\n   \"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That\\'s not ages, that\\'s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\"\\n   \"But what are you going to do with it when it\\'s hatched?\" said Hermione.\\n   \"Well, that\\'s something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can we have a window open? I\\'m boiling.\"\\n   \"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape-she didn\\'t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\\n   What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\\'s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\\n   \"I\\'m going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don\\'t, all the Slytherins will think I\\'m just too scared to face Snape. I\\'ll show them... it\\'ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\"\\n   \"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\"\\n   \"I can\\'t,\" said Harry. \"There isn\\'t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\\'t play at all.\"\\n   Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n   \"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these:Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\\'s Guide.\"\\n   \"Hagrid, you live in awooden house,\" she said.\\n   But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\\'t going to stop him.\\n   The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\\n   It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket-but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn\\'t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\\n   It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\\n   14. NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\\n   Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\\'s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\\n   \"It\\'s notmy fault,\" said Wood. \"We\\'ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\\'t got an excuse to pick on us.\"\\n   Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch...\\n   The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\\n   \"It-well-it shows me my family-\"\\n   \"And no wonder we couldn\\'t find Flamel in thatStudy of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron.\"He\\'s not exactly recent if he\\'s six hundred and sixty five, is he?\"\\n   The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\\n   \"Don\\'t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\\'s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\"\\n   \"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said Harry, \"about what\\'s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy-\"\\n   \"Say you\\'re ill,\" said Ron.\\n   \"Quick!\"\\n   Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.\\n   \"Don\\'t play,\" said Hermione at once.\\n   \"See you later, then,\" said Harry.\\n   Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face-he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\\n   \"What? Where?\"\\n   Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\\n   Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\\'d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\\n   \"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las\\' night. I was down in the village havin\\' a few drinks an\\' got into a game o\\' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\"\\n   \"Can you see all your family standing around you?\"\\n   \"No.\"\\n   \"Why not?\"\\n   \"I knew it! Iknew it!\"\\n   \"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\"\\n   When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\\'s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\\n   Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\\n   \"Wonder what it\\'s like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\\n   There have been many reports of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty eight).\\n   \"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \"Don\\' go shoutin\\' about it, what\\'s the matter with yeh?\"\\n   \"There\\'s no need to tell me I\\'m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\\'s already done that,\" Neville choked out.\\n   Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied,\"The Restricted Section? Well, they can\\'t be far, we\\'ll catch them.\"\\n   Harry stood up.\\n   \"Snape\\'s refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When\\'s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\\'s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\"\\n   The snow still hadn\\'t melted the next morning.\\n   \"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single handed! He\\'s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he\\'ll be all right-talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone\\'s waiting for you in the common room, we\\'re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\"\\n   \"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically,\"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone!\"\\n   Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren\\'t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon\\'s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning \\n   \"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\"\\n   Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted-so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry-unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry-he couldn\\'t move for fear.\\n   Then a pain like he\\'d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.\\n   The pain in Harry\\'s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white blond hair and a palomino body.\\n   \"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\"\\n   And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.\\n   The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\\'s Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Hagrid\\'s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.\\n   \"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \"I\\'m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon\\'s the most horrible animal I\\'ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\\'d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\"\\n   There was a tap on the dark window.\\n   \"It\\'s Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She\\'ll have Charlie\\'s answer!\"\\n   The three of them put their heads together to read the note.\\n   Dear Ron,\\n   How are you? Thanks for the letter-I\\'d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won\\'t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\\'t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\\n   Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it\\'s still dark.\\n   Send me an answer as soon as possible.\\n   Love,\\n   Charlie\\n   They looked at one another.\\n   \"We\\'ve got the Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn\\'t be too difficult-I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\"\\n   It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert-and Malfoy.\\n   There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\\'s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn\\'t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey-would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\\'s fangs were poisonous.\\n   Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\\n   \"It\\'s not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it\\'s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me-I\\'ve told her it was a dog, but I don\\'t think she believes me. I shouldn\\'t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\\'s why he\\'s doing this.\"\\n   Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\\n   \"It\\'ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this didn\\'t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.\\n   \"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no-oh no-I\\'ve just remembered-Charlie\\'s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\\'s going to know we\\'re getting rid of Norbert.\"\\n   Harry and Hermione didn\\'t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\\n   \"It\\'s too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven\\'t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We\\'ll have to risk it. And wehave got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn\\'t know about that.\"\\n   They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\\n   \"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It\\'s one o\\'clock in the morning.Explain yourselves.\"\\n   It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher\\'s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\\n   \"I want Fang,\" said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\\'s long teeth.\\n   \"All right-all right-\" he heard Quirrell sob.\\n   Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn\\'t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell\\'s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he\\'d promised himself about not meddling.\\n   All the same, he\\'d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\\'s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step-Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\\n   Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he\\'d heard.\\n   \"Snape\\'s done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell\\'s told him how to break his Anti Dark Force spell-\"\\n   \"There\\'s still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione.\\n   \"Maybe Snape\\'s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\" said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \"I bet there\\'s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\"\\n   The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\\'s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\\n   \"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested.\\n   \"I\\'ve decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\\'s Mommy?\"\\n   \"He\\'sgone?\" said Harry frantically.\"Now?\"\\n   \"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time-\"\\n   \"But this is servant stuff, it\\'s not for students to do. I thought we\\'d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\\'d-\"\\n   \"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly.\\n   \"A werewolf?\" Harry suggested.\\n   \"That wasn\\' no werewolf an\\' it wasn\\' no unicorn, neither,\" said Hagrid grimly. \"Right, follow me, but careful, now.\"\\n   They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\\n   \"Who\\'s there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself-I\\'m armed!\"\\n   And into the clearing came-was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\\'s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\\'s jaws dropped.\\n   \"Oh, it\\'s you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\"\\n   He walked forward and shook the centaur\\'s hand.\\n   \"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\"\\n   \"Well enough. Look, I\\'ve jus\\' bin askin\\' Ronan, you seen anythin\\' odd in here lately? There\\'s a unicorn bin injured-would yeh know anythin\\' about it?\"\\n   Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward.\"Mars is bright tonight,\" he said simply.\\n   \"We\\'ve heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. \"Well, if either of you do see anythin\\', let me know, won\\'t yeh? We\\'ll be off, then.\"\\n   Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\\n   \"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, \"try an\\' get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\\' closer\\'n the moon.\"\\n   \"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\\n   \"Yes-thank you-whatwas that?\"\\n   The centaur didn\\'t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry\\'s forehead.\\n   \"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time-especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.\\n   \"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\\n   There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.\\n   \"Follow me,\" said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\\n   \"I don\\'t care if Malfoy has, but if something\\'s got Neville... it\\'s our fault he\\'s here in the first place.\"\\n   The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry\\'s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?\\n   At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\\'s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.\\n   \"We\\'ll be lucky ter catch anythin\\' now, with the racket you two were makin\\'. Right, we\\'re changin\\' groups-Neville, you stay with me an\\' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\\' this idiot. I\\'m sorry,\" Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \"but he\\'ll have a harder time frightenin\\' you, an\\' we\\'ve gotta get this done.\"\\n   So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.\\n   \"Look-\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\\n   Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\\n   It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves.\\n   Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal\\'s side, and began to drink its blood.\\n   \"Aargh! It\\'s all right, he only got my boot-jus\\' playin\\'-he\\'s only a baby, after all.\"\\n   The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn\\'t come quickly enough.\\n   They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to Norbert if they hadn\\'t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid\\'s hut because they\\'d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he\\'d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\\n   \"He\\'s lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry\\'s ear.\\n   \"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\"\\n   \"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We\\'ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\"\\n   \"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\"\\n   Harry stared at the back of Firenze\\'s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\\n   \"Bye bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \"Mommy will never forget you!\"\\n   How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another-even one of Harry\\'s shortcuts didn\\'t make the work much easier.\\n   \"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.\\n   Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\\n   Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.\\n   \"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\\'s bin killin\\' the unicorns-never heard anythin\\' like it before.\"\\n   They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid\\'s arm.\\n   \"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert\\'s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\"\\n   Hagrid bit his lip.\\n   \"I-I know I can\\'t keep him forever, but I can\\'t jus\\' dump him, I can\\'t.\"\\n   Harry suddenly turned to Ron.\"Charlie,\" he said.\\n   \"You\\'re losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I\\'m Ron, remember?\"\\n   \"No-Charlie-your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\"\\n   \"But this is important.\"\\n   \"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\"\\n   \"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor-it\\'s about the Sorcerer\\'s stone-\"\\n   Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\\'t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn\\'t pick them up. \"How do you know ?\" she spluttered.\\n   \"-tell yer that\\'s how it is at Hogwarts,\" Hagrid growled. \"Copyin\\' lines! What good\\'s that ter anyone? Yeh\\'ll do summat useful or yeh\\'ll get out. If yeh think yer father\\'d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an\\' pack. Go on.\"\\n   Malfoy didn\\'t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.\\n   \"Right then,\" said Hagrid, \"now, listen carefully, \\'cause it\\'s dangerous what we\\'re gonna do tonight, an\\' I don\\' want no one takin\\' risks. Follow me over here a moment.\"\\n   He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.\\n   \"Look there,\" said Hagrid, \"see that stuff shinin\\' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That\\'s unicorn blood. There\\'s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\\'re gonna try an\\' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\"\\n   \"Are there many ofthem in here?\" asked Hermione.\\n   \"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\\'re good enough about turnin\\' up if ever I want a word. They\\'re deep mind, centaurs... they know things... jus\\' don\\' let on much.\"\\n   \"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, howdare you-\"\\n   \"You don\\'t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\\'s coming-he\\'s got a dragon!\"\\n   \"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on-I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\"\\n   The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they\\'d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\\n   \"Malfoy\\'s got detention! I could sing!\"\\n   \"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn\\' take his cloak off.\"\\n   He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\\n   \"It\\'s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\\' funny folk in the Hog\\'s Head-that\\'s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\\' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\"\\n   Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.\"What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\"\\n   \"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \"Yeah... he asked what I did, an\\' I told him I was gamekeeper here... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an\\' I said what I\\'d always really wanted was a dragon... an\\' then... I can\\' remember too well, \\'cause he kept buyin\\' me drinks... Let\\'s see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an\\' we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn\\' want it ter go ter any old home... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...\"\\n   \"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\" said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.\\n   \"There\\'s nothin\\' that lives in the forest that\\'ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' keep ter the path. Right, now, we\\'re gonna split inter two parties an\\' follow the trail in diff\\'rent directions. There\\'s blood all over the place, it must\\'ve bin staggerin\\' around since last night at least.\"\\n   \"I wish I knew what thismeans!\" he burst out angrily.\"My scar keeps hurting-it\\'s happened before, but never as often as this.\"\\n   \"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \"Were you going to shoot me?\"\\n   \"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked.\\n   \"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid. \"It\\'s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they\\'re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\"\\n   They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.\\n   \"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered. \"Don\\' worry, it can\\'t\\'ve gone far if it\\'s this badly hurt, an\\' then we\\'ll be able ter-GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\"\\n   Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\\n   \"I shouldn\\'t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\" said Filch coldly, \"they\\'re here to be punished, after all.\"\\n   \"That\\'s why yer late, is it?\" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \"Bin lecturin\\' them, eh? \\'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\\'ve done yer bit, I\\'ll take over from here.\"\\n   \"I\\'m disgusted,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Four students out of bed in one night! I\\'ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions-yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom,nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it\\'s very dangerous-and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\"\\n   \"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn\\'t have done so... Bane was furious... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen... They must show that Voldemort\\'s coming back... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me... I suppose that\\'s written in the stars as well.\"\\n   \"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed.\\n   \"So all I\\'ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry went on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off... Well, I suppose Bane\\'ll be happy.\"\\n   Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\\n   \"Harry, relax, Hermione\\'s right, the Stone\\'s safe as long as Dumbledore\\'s around. Anyway, we\\'ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\\'s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\"\\n   Harry nodded, but he couldn\\'t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he\\'d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That\\'s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we\\'d done that one.\"\\n   Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\\'t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never...but...\\n   Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.\\n   \"Where\\'re you going?\" said Ron sleepily.\\n   \"I\\'ve just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white. \"We\\'ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\"\\n   \"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\\n   \"Don\\'t,\" Harry advised her.\\n   Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.\\n   Charlie\\'s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they\\'d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.\\n   At last, Norbert was going... going...gone.\\n   They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon-Malfoy in detention-what could spoil their happiness?\\n   The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch\\'s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\\n   \"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"weare in trouble.\"\\n   They\\'d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.\\n   15. THE FORBIDDEN FOREST\\n   Things couldn\\'t have been worse.\\n   Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall\\'s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry\\'s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn\\'t see how they were going to get out of trouble thistime. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\\n   Had Harry thought that things couldn\\'t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\\n   \"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore\\'s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\\'t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that\\'s a very imprecise branch of magic.\"\\n   The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night\\'s surprises weren\\'t over.\\n   When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\\n   Just in case.\\n   16. THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\\n   In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\\n   It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\\n   They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox-points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\\n   Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn\\'t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\\n   Maybe it was because they hadn\\'t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn\\'t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn\\'t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\\'t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn\\'t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\\n   Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who\\'d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they\\'d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\\'t help cheering with the rest.\\n   \"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn\\'t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\"\\n   Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.\"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we\\'ve got a week before we find out how badly we\\'ve done, there\\'s no need to worry yet.\"\\n   Harry was rubbing his forehead.\\n   \"I won\\'t let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert\\'s at a tricky stage-nothin\\' I can\\'t handle.\"\\n   When they told him about Charlie\\'s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\\n   \"Abou\\' time,\" he said. \"I bin waitin\\' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\"\\n   \"I shouldn\\'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey-where\\'re yeh goin\\'?\"\\n   Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn\\'t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.\\n   \"We\\'ve got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak-it must\\'ve been easy, once he\\'d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn\\'t stop him. Where\\'s Dumbledore\\'s office?\"\\n   They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\\n   \"We\\'ll just have to-\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.\\n   \"What are you three doing inside?\"\\n   It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\\n   \"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\\n   \"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\"\\n   Harry swallowed-now what?\\n   \"It\\'s sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn\\'t, because Professor McGonagall\\'s nostrils flared.\\n   \"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\"\\n   \"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\"\\n   \"Good evening,\" said Ronan. \"Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\"\\n   \"Fifty pointseach,\" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.\\n   \"Professor-please-\"\\n   \"Youcan\\'t-\"\\n   \"Don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it\\'s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don\\'t you think? Why didn\\'t I see it before?\"\\n   \"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn\\'t answer.\\n   Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\\n   \"I bet you\\'ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\\'t you, eh?\" he said, leering at them. \"Oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me... It\\'s just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I\\'ve got the chains still in my office, keep \\'em well oiled in case they\\'re ever needed... Right, off we go, and don\\'t think of running off, now, it\\'ll be worse for you if you do.\"\\n   They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn\\'t be sounding so delighted.\\n   The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid\\'s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.\\n   \"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\"\\n   Harry\\'s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn\\'t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, \"I suppose you think you\\'ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy-it\\'s into the forest you\\'re going and I\\'m much mistaken if you\\'ll all come out in one piece.\"\\n   At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.\\n   \"The forest?\" he repeated, and he didn\\'t sound quite as cool as usual. \"We can\\'t go in there at night-there\\'s all sorts of things in there-werewolves, I heard.\"\\n   Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry\\'s robe and made a choking noise.\\n   \"That\\'s your problem, isn\\'t it?\" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \"Should\\'ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\\'t you?\"\\n   Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\\n   \"All right, but I warn yeh, he\\'s a coward,\" said Hagrid. \"So me, Harry, an\\' Hermione\\'ll go one way an\\' Draco, Neville, an\\' Fang\\'ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\\'ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an\\' practice now-that\\'s it-an\\' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\\' we\\'ll all come an\\' find yeh-so, be careful-let\\'s go.\"\\n   The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.\\n   They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves.\\n   Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\\n   \"D\\'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry.\\n   \"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that wasVol-\"\\n   \"Harry!\" Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag-\"\\n   Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.\\n   \"I\\'ll be back at dawn,\" said Filch, \"for what\\'s left of them,\" he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.\\n   Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.\\n   \"I\\'m not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it\\'s a warning... it means danger\\'s coming...\"\\n   Ron couldn\\'t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n   \"He\\'s got lots o\\' rats an\\' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \"An\\' I\\'ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\"\\n   From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.\\n   \"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"\\n   It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\\'s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\"\\n   \"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\"\\n   And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\\n   Harry didn\\'t have a clue what was going on.\\n   \"Why\\'s Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\"\\n   Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\\'s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn\\'t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\\n   \"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\"\\n   Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.\\n   \"I\\'m not going in that forest,\" he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.\\n   \"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\" said Hagrid fiercely. \"Yeh\\'ve done wrong an\\' now yeh\\'ve got ter pay fer it.\"\\n   \"But we\\'ve got noproof!\" said Harry.\"Quirrell\\'s too scared to back us up. Snape\\'s only got to say he doesn\\'t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor-who do you think they\\'ll believe, him or us? It\\'s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\\'ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\\'t help us if his life depended on it, he\\'s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\\'ll think. And don\\'t forget, we\\'re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\\'ll take a lot of explaining.\"\\n   Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\\'t.\\n   \"If we just do a bit of poking around-\"\\n   \"No,\" said Harry flatly, \"we\\'ve done enough poking around.\"\\n   He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.\\n   The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\\n   Your detention will take place at eleven o\\'clock tonight.\\n   Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\\n   Professor McGonagall\\n   Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they\\'d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn\\'t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\\'d got.\\n   At eleven o\\'clock that night, they said good bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there-and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.\\n   \"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\"\\n   Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\\n   \"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\"\\n   \"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\"\\n   Ronan pawed the ground nervously.\"I\\'m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\" he said in his gloomy voice.\\n   Bane kicked his back legs in anger.\\n   \"Go to Dumbledore. That\\'s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\\'ll be thrown out for sure.\"\\n   \"But who\\'d be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you\\'re going to be cursed forever, death\\'s better, isn\\'t it?\"\\n   \"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else-something that will bring you back to full strength and power-something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\"\\n   \"The Sorcerer\\'s Stone! Of course-the Elixir of Life! But I don\\'t understand who-\"\\n   \"Can\\'t be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. \"There\\'s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\\' Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\\' this is Ronan, you two. He\\'s a centaur.\"\\n   \"We\\'d noticed,\" said Hermione faintly.\\n   \"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\"\\n   He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\\n   Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\n   Harry couldn\\'t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\\n   \"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort\\'s waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich...\"\\n   \"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\\n   Harry wasn\\'t listening.\\n   \"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"\\n   \"Don\\'t tell me what I can and can\\'t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I\\'ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\"\\n   A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they\\'d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?\\n   Harry didn\\'t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\\'t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they\\'d done?\\n   At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there\\'d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.\\n   From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\\'t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \"Thanks, Potter, we owe you one!\"\\n   Only Ron stood by him.\\n   \"They\\'ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they\\'ve been here, and people still like them.\"\\n   \"They\\'ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\" said Harry miserably.\\n   \"Well-no,\" Ron admitted.\\n   It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren\\'t his business from now on. He\\'d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\\n   \"Resign?\" Wood thundered.\"What good\\'ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can\\'t win at Quidditch?\"\\n   But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\\'t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \"the Seeker.\"\\n   Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\\'t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\\'t as well known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.\\n   Harry was almost glad that the exams weren\\'t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions...\\n   Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\\'s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn\\'t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\\'s voice.\\n   \"No-no-not again, please-\"\\n   It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.\\n   \"Always the innocent are the first victims,\" he said. \"So it has been for ages past, so it is now.\"\\n   \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin\\', Ronan? Anythin\\' unusual?\"\\n   \"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \"Unusually bright.\"\\n   \"Yeah, but I was meanin\\' anythin\\' unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. \"So yeh haven\\'t noticed anythin\\' strange?\"\\n   Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said,\"The forest hides many secrets.\"\\n   A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black haired and bodied and wilder looking than Ronan.\\n   \"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\"\\n   \"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\\n   \"No, we\\'re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\\'ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\"\\n   \"Erm-\"\\n   \"A bit. Well, that\\'s something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\"\\n   \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I\\'m glad we\\'ve run inter yeh, Ronan, \\'cause there\\'s a unicorn bin hurt-you seen anythin\\'?\"\\n   Ronan didn\\'t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.\\n   \"And did he-did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm.\\n   \"Well-yeah-how many three headed dogs d\\'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\\'s a piece o\\' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\\' play him a bit o\\' music an\\' he\\'ll go straight off ter sleep-\"\\n   Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.\\n   \"I think I\\'ve got a good idea of what\\'s been going on,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"It doesn\\'t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I\\'ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\\'sfunny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\"\\n   Harry caught Neville\\'s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn\\'t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville-Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.\\n   \"I\\'m fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The unicorn\\'s dead, Hagrid, it\\'s in that clearing back there.\"\\n   \"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\"\\n   Harry slid off his back.\\n   \"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\"\\n   \"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Stay on the path, I\\'ll come back for yeh!\"\\n   They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn\\'t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.\\n   \"You don\\'t think they\\'ve been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione.\\n   \"I knew it,\" he murmured. \"There\\'s summat in here that shouldn\\' be.\"\\n   \"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\"\\n   Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted-so did Fang. The hooded figure\\n   \"Be warned, Potter-any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\"\\n   He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\\n   Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\\n   \"Right, here\\'s what we\\'ve got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape-wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\\'d better do that.\"\\n   \"Why me?\"\\n   \"It\\'s okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it\\'s a soft landing, you can jump!\"\\n   Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\\n   \"What\\'s this stuff?\" were his first words.\\n   \"GO!\"\\n   Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\\n   Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.\\n   \"Hermione!\"\\n   \"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seekit... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\" Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me...\"\\n   Quirrell\\'s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid? He\\'dseen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n   Quirrell cursed under his breath.\\n   \"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this place tonight.\"\\n   \"I won\\'t let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \"I\\'ll-I\\'ll fight you!\"\\n   \"Neville,\" she said, \"I\\'m really, really sorry about this.\"\\n   She raised her wand.\\n   \"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.\\n   \"It\\'s obvious, isn\\'t it?\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve got to play our way across the room.\"\\n   Behind the white pieces they could see another door.\\n   \"I don\\'t know... sounds like wings to me.\"\\n   \"There\\'s light ahead-I can see something moving.\"\\n   They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\\n   \"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\"\\n   \"Ron-\"\\n   \"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\"\\n   \"It\\'s not poison?\" said Harry anxiously.\\n   \"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\\'re not throwing me out after that.\"\\n   After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\\'t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn\\'t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\\n   Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\\n   \"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron.\\n   A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third floor corridor-and the door was already ajar.\\n   \"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape\\'s already got past Fluffy.\"\\n   Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\\n   \"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here goes...\"\\n   He put Hagrid\\'s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\\'t really a tune, but from the first note the beast\\'s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog\\'s growls ceased-it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\\n   \"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,One among us seven will let you move ahead,Another will transport the drinker back instead,Two among our number hold only nettle wine,Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:First, however slyly the poison tries to hideYou will always find some on nettle wine\\'s left side;Second, different are those who stand at either end,But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;Fourth, the second left and the second on the rightAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\\n   Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\\n   \"But Harry-what if You-Know-Who\\'s with him?\"\\n   \"Well-I was lucky once, wasn\\'t I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar. \"I might get lucky again.\"\\n   Hermione\\'s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.\\n   \"How?\" said Hermione nervously.\\n   \"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I\\'ll not bother you.\"\\n   And he scooted off.\\n   \"Brilliant,\" said Hermione.\"This isn\\'t magic-it\\'s logic-a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\\'t got an ounce of logic, they\\'d be stuck in here forever.\"\\n   \"But there arehundreds of them!\"\\n   Ron examined the lock on the door.\\n   \"We\\'re looking for a big, old fashioned one-probably silver, like the handle.\"\\n   They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\\n   Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\\'t. After a minute\\'s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\\n   \"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one-there-no, there-with bright blue wings-the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\\n   Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\\n   \"We\\'ve got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above-Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\\'ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\"\\n   Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione\\'s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\\n   They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned-it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.\\n   \"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.\\n   The next chamber was so dark they couldn\\'t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.\\n   They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly-the towering white chessmen had no faces.\\n   \"Now what?\" said Ron.\\n   \"These birds... they can\\'t be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione.\\n   They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering-glittering?\\n   \"They\\'re not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They\\'rekeys! Winged keys-look carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"...yes-look! Broomsticks! We\\'ve got to catch the key to the door!\"\\n   \"But what can we-\"\\n   Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\\n   Snape was standing there.\\n   \"Good luck-take care.\"\\n   \"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer\\'s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\\n   \"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\\'s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\\n   \"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously.\\n   \"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered.\\n   \"It\\'s obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \"\\'Oh Professor Flitwick, I\\'m so worried, I think I got question fourteenb wrong...\\'\"\\n   \"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\"\\n   Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.\\n   \"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\" he said greasily. \"My mistake, my mistake-I didn\\'t see you-of course I didn\\'t, you\\'re invisible-forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\"\\n   \"I saw you and Snape in the forest-\" he blurted out.\\n   \"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\\'d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me-as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side...\"\\n   Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\\n   \"I suppose you think you\\'re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\" she stormed. \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you\\'ve come anywhere near here again, I\\'ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\"\\n   Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said,\"At least Hermione\\'s on Snape\\'s tail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.\\n   \"If you want to go back, I won\\'t blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the cloak, I won\\'t need it now.\"\\n   \"Don\\'t you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. \"I don\\'t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\"\\n   \"Yes, but not tous,\" said Ron in exasperation.\"Neville, you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing.\"\\n   He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.\\n   \"Go on.\"\\n   Harry pushed it open.\\n   A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.\\n   \"I\\'m going out of here tonight and I\\'m going to try and get to the Stone first.\"\\n   \"You\\'re mad!\" said Ron.\\n   \"You can\\'t!\" said Hermione. \"After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You\\'ll be expelled!\"\\n   \"SO WHAT?\" Harry shouted. \"Don\\'t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\\'s coming back! Haven\\'t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\\'t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\\'ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\\'t matter anymore, can\\'t you see? D\\'you think he\\'ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\\'ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\\'s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\\'m never going over to the Dark Side! I\\'m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\"\\n   He glared at them.\\n   \"You\\'re right, Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice.\\n   \"I\\'m glad we didn\\'t have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can\\'t breathe.\"\\n   He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next-but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\\n   \"Snape\\'s,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\"\\n   They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn\\'t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\\n   \"Look, if you don\\'t hurry up, he\\'ll already have the Stone!\"\\n   There was no alternative.\\n   \"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go-now, don\\'t hang around once you\\'ve won.\"\\n   He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor-Hermione screamed but stayed on her square-the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\\'d been knocked out.\\n   Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\\n   The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\\'s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.\\n   \"What if he\\'s-?\"\\n   \"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\\n   It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn\\'t feel them-for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire-then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\\n   There was already someone there-but it wasn\\'t Snape. It wasn\\'t even Voldemort.\\n   17. THE MAN WITH TWO FACES\\n   It was Quirrell.\\n   \"You!\" gasped Harry.\\n   Quirrell smiled. His face wasn\\'t twitching at all.\\n   \"NO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted.\\n   \"That\\'s chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You\\'ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she\\'ll take me-that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\"\\n   \"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered.\\n   Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.\\n   \"Do you think they\\'ll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron.\\n   \"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. \"I don\\'t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it\\'s too well protected.\"\\n   \"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\"\\n   \"Oh, let\\'s kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry\\'s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\\'t do anything.\\n   They didn\\'t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.\\n   \"Who\\'s there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \"Know you\\'re there, even if I can\\'t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\"\\n   He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\\n   \"Should call Filch, I should, if something\\'s a creeping around unseen.\"\\n   Harry had a sudden idea.\\n   \"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville.\\n   Neville\\'s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.\\n   Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville\\'s jaws were jammed together so he couldn\\'t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\\n   \"What\\'ve you done to him?\" Harry whispered.\\n   \"It\\'s tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \"Snape\\'s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\\'s found out everything he needs, and now he\\'s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\"\\n   \"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron.\\n   \"And we\\'d better stay outside the third floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron. \"Come on.\"\\n   But that part of the plan didn\\'t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\\n   \"I think,\" said Ron, \"we\\'re going to have to be chessmen.\"\\n   He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight\\'s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\\n   \"Do you think it\\'s a ghost?\"\\n   \"I don\\'t understand... is the Stoneinside the mirror? Should I break it?\"\\n   Harry\\'s mind was racing.\\n   What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding it-which means I\\'ll see where it\\'s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\\'m up to?\\n   He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\\n   \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\"\\n   And to Harry\\'s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.\\n   \"Use the boy... Use the boy...\"\\n   Quirrell rounded on Harry.\\n   \"Yes-Potter-come here.\"\\n   He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.\\n   \"Devil\\'s Snare, Devil\\'s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say?-it likes the dark and the damp-\"\\n   \"So light a fire!\" Harry choked.\\n   \"Yes-of course-but there\\'s no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands.\\n   \"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"\\n   Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.\\n   \"We\\'re nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think-let me think...\"\\n   The white queen turned her blank face toward him.\\n   \"Yes...\" said Ron softly, \"It\\'s the only way... I\\'ve got to be taken.\"\\n   \"Neville,\" Ron exploded,\"get away from that hole and don\\'t be an idiot-\"\\n   \"Dosomething,\" he said desperately.\\n   Hermione stepped forward.\\n   \"No, I don\\'t!\"\\n   \"All right?\" Harry whispered.\\n   \"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly.\\n   They stared at him.\\n   \"You shouldn\\'t be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd, twisted smile.\\n   \"We were-\" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\\n   \"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around like this, people will think you\\'re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\\'t afford to lose any more points, can it?\"\\n   Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\\n   \"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy-he didn\\'t feel much like singing.\\n   He ran back down to the common room.\\n   \"We\\'d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us-if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own-\"\\n   \"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\\'d been making another bid for freedom.\\n   \"Nothing-just black-there\\'s no way of climbing down, we\\'ll just have to drop.\"\\n   Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.\\n   \"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don\\'t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\"\\n   Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\\' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.\\n   Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.\\n   He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said,\"If anything happens to me, don\\'t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\"\\n   \"Right,\" said Ron.\\n   \"See you in a minute, I hope...\"\\n   And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and-\\n   FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.\\n   \"It\\'s the full Body Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I\\'m so sorry.\"\\n   \"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry.\\n   \"You\\'ll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.\\n   But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\\'t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\\'s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.\\n   \"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\\n   \"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione.\"Look at you both!\"\\n   She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\\n   Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.\\n   \"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is-it\\'s Devil\\'s Snare!\"\\n   \"Oh, come off it, you don\\'t think we\\'d let you go alone?\"\\n   \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\"\\n   \"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\"\\n   \"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.\\n   Neville stared at their guilty faces.\\n   \"You\\'re going out again,\" he said.\\n   \"No, no, no.I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\\'d have got you off that broom. I\\'d have managed it before then if Snape hadn\\'t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\"\\n   \"Snape was trying tosave me?\"\\n   \"Oh, I\\'m so glad we know what it\\'s called, that\\'s a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \"Shut up, I\\'m trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione.\\n   \"Well, hurry up, I can\\'t breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.\\n   \"Do we-er-have to join you to get across?\" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\\n   \"This needs thinking about he said. I suppose we\\'ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces...\"\\n   Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\"Now, don\\'t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess-\"\\n   \"We\\'re not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"\\n   \"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go next to him instead of that castle.\"\\n   \"What about you?\"\\n   \"I\\'m not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.\\n   \"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I\\'d be meeting you here, Potter.\"\\n   \"But Professor-\"\\n   \"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don\\'t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there\\'s no other choice... I\\'ll run.\"\\n   He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.\\n   The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn\\'t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\\n   \"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\"\\n   It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\\n   \"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he\\'s in London... I\\'ll be far away by the time he gets back...\"\\n   All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.\\n   \"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I-I\\'ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.\"\\n   Quirrell cursed again.\\n   \"Give me a minute.\"\\n   Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.\\n   \"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\"\\n   \"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.\\n   \"Be warned, Potter-any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\"\\n   He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\\n   Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\\n   \"Right, here\\'s what we\\'ve got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape-wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\\'d better do that.\"\\n   \"Why me?\"\\n   \"It\\'s okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it\\'s a soft landing, you can jump!\"\\n   Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\\n   \"What\\'s this stuff?\" were his first words.\\n   \"GO!\"\\n   Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\\n   Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.\\n   \"Hermione!\"\\n   \"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seekit... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\" Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me...\"\\n   Quirrell\\'s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid? He\\'dseen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n   Quirrell cursed under his breath.\\n   \"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this place tonight.\"\\n   \"I won\\'t let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \"I\\'ll-I\\'ll fight you!\"\\n   \"Neville,\" she said, \"I\\'m really, really sorry about this.\"\\n   She raised her wand.\\n   \"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.\\n   \"It\\'s obvious, isn\\'t it?\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve got to play our way across the room.\"\\n   Behind the white pieces they could see another door.\\n   \"I don\\'t know... sounds like wings to me.\"\\n   \"There\\'s light ahead-I can see something moving.\"\\n   They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\\n   \"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\"\\n   \"Ron-\"\\n   \"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\"\\n   \"It\\'s not poison?\" said Harry anxiously.\\n   \"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\\'re not throwing me out after that.\"\\n   After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\\'t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn\\'t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\\n   Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\\n   \"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron.\\n   A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third floor corridor-and the door was already ajar.\\n   \"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape\\'s already got past Fluffy.\"\\n   Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\\n   \"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here goes...\"\\n   He put Hagrid\\'s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\\'t really a tune, but from the first note the beast\\'s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog\\'s growls ceased-it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\\n   \"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,One among us seven will let you move ahead,Another will transport the drinker back instead,Two among our number hold only nettle wine,Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:First, however slyly the poison tries to hideYou will always find some on nettle wine\\'s left side;Second, different are those who stand at either end,But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;Fourth, the second left and the second on the rightAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\\n   Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\\n   \"But Harry-what if You-Know-Who\\'s with him?\"\\n   \"Well-I was lucky once, wasn\\'t I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar. \"I might get lucky again.\"\\n   Hermione\\'s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.\\n   \"How?\" said Hermione nervously.\\n   \"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I\\'ll not bother you.\"\\n   And he scooted off.\\n   \"Brilliant,\" said Hermione.\"This isn\\'t magic-it\\'s logic-a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\\'t got an ounce of logic, they\\'d be stuck in here forever.\"\\n   \"But there arehundreds of them!\"\\n   Ron examined the lock on the door.\\n   \"We\\'re looking for a big, old fashioned one-probably silver, like the handle.\"\\n   They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\\n   Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\\'t. After a minute\\'s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\\n   \"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one-there-no, there-with bright blue wings-the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\\n   Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\\n   \"We\\'ve got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above-Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\\'ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\"\\n   Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione\\'s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\\n   They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned-it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.\\n   \"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.\\n   The next chamber was so dark they couldn\\'t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.\\n   They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly-the towering white chessmen had no faces.\\n   \"Now what?\" said Ron.\\n   \"These birds... they can\\'t be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione.\\n   They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering-glittering?\\n   \"They\\'re not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They\\'rekeys! Winged keys-look carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked ar\\n   \"Ah-your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\" Dumbledore\\'s eyes twinkled. \"Useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\"\\n   \"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man\\'s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts...\\n   \"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to-Dumbledore was so worried-\"\\n   \"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort.\\n   Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\\'s face-\\n   \"Absolutely not.\"\\n   \"You must be Harry\\'s family!\" said Mrs. Weasley.\\n   \"It wasyou.\"\\n   \"I have strength enough... for this...\"\\n   Harry felt as if Devil\\'s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\\'t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell\\'s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\\n   Harry would have screamed, but he couldn\\'t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell\\'s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\\n   \"Harry!\"\\n   Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\\n   \"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \"They don\\'t know we\\'re not allowed to use magic at home. I\\'m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...\"\\n   \"...for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\\n   Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects,\"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\\'s giant chess set!\"\\n   At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\\n   \"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\\'t realize that love as powerful as your mother\\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\"\\n   Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said,\"And the Invisibility Cloak-do you know who sent it to me?\"\\n   \"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes...\\n   \"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\\'s got the Stone! Sir, quick-\"\\n   \"D\\'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your father\\'s cloak and everything?\"\\n   \"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\"\\n   Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\\n   \"And sir, there\\'s one more thing...\"\\n   \"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly.\\n   Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.\\n   \"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\\n   \"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.\\n   \"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\"\\n   After a good night\\'s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\\n   \"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we haven\\'t got all day.\" He walked away.\\n   Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\\n   \"See you, Potter!\"\\n   \"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I\\'ll need something to look forward to.\" People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:\\n   \"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\"\\n   \"Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"\\n   The room went very still. The Slytherins\\' smiles faded a little.\\n   \"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know.\"\\n   And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms-Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\\n   \"Then who does? Sir, I-\"\\n   \"He lies... He lies...\"\\n   \"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\'t realize how risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\"\\n   \"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\"\\n   \"Second-to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\\n   Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves-they were a hundred points up.\\n   \"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\"\\n   \"But that means he and his wife will die, won\\'t they?\"\\n   \"Third-to Mr. Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet \"...for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"\\n   The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points-exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup-if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\\n   Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\\n   \"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\"\\n   Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\\'s face.\\n   \"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send youa toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\"\\n   \"How touching...\" it hissed. \"I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your parents were brave... I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight... but your mother needn\\'t have died... she was trying to protect you... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\"\\n   \"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. \\'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead-anyway, got yeh this...\"\\n   It seemed to be a handsome, leather covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.\\n   \"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I\\'ve been thinking... sir-even if the Stone\\'s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who-\"\\n   \"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said Dumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\"\\n   \"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\"\\n   Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\\'t have looked more stunned and horrified if he\\'d just had the Body Bind Curse put on him.\\n   \"Yeah, Dumbledore\\'s off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly. \"Listen, you\\'ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course-you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you-but the food\\'ll be good.\"\\n   But he hadn\\'t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn\\'t moving his lips.\\n   \"He saved his life.\"\\n   \"Which means,\" Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\"\\n   He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall\\'s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry\\'s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\\'s feelings toward him hadn\\'t changed one jot. This didn\\'t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\\n   It was the best evening of Harry\\'s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight.\\n   Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn\\'t have everything in life.\\n   At last there was silence again.\\n   \"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor... I have form only when I can share another\\'s body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds... Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own... Now... why don\\'t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\"\\n   So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\\'s legs. He stumbled backward.\\n   \"Fire away.\"\\n   \"Ready, are you?\"\\n   It was Uncle Vernon, still purple faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.\\n   \"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you-I\\'ll send you an owl.\"\\n   \"That\\'s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that-what was it?-\\'to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\\'\"\\n   \"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey...\"\\n   \"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \"Youdid do the thing properly, didn\\'t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it\\'s all for the best.\"\\n   \"But why couldn\\'t Quirrell touch me?\"\\n   A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.\\n   \"Yes...\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people\\'s minds work, isn\\'t it? Professor Snape couldn\\'t bear being in your father\\'s debt... I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father\\'s memory in peace...\"\\n   Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.\\n   \"And there\\'s something else...\"\\n   \"First-to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"\\n   Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\\n   \"AAAARGH!\"\\n   Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn\\'t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain-his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\\n   Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off-the pain in Harry\\'s head was building-he couldn\\'t see-he could only hear Quirrell\\'s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\\'s yells of, \"KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry\\'s own head, crying, \"Harry! Harry!\"\\n   He felt Quirrell\\'s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down... down... down...\\n   Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.\\n   He blinked. It wasn\\'t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.\\n   He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.\\n   \"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he\\'d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we\\'re talking about, he\\'d have found out even if you hadn\\'t told him.\"\\n   \"Yes, him-Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\"\\n   \"Well,\" Hermione exploded,\"if he did-I mean to say that\\'s terrible-you could have been killed.\"\\n   \"Not the Stone, boy, you-the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\"\\n   \"Don\\'t be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join me... or you\\'ll meet the same end as your parents... They died begging me for mercy...\"\\n   \"Let me speak to him... face-to-face...\"\\n   \"NEVER!\"\\n   Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed\"SEIZE HIM!\" and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\\'s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle sharp pain seared across Harry\\'s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened-he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers-they were blistering before his eyes.\\n   \"Sent owls off ter all yer parents\\' old school friends, askin\\' fer photos... knew yeh didn\\' have any... d\\'yeh like it?\"\\n   Harry couldn\\'t speak, but Hagrid understood.\\n   Harry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey\\'s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin\\'s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\\n   When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.\\n   Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\\n   \"Be quiet, Ginny, and it\\'s rude to point.\"\\n   Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\\n   \"But sit, the Stone-\"\\n   \"I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. \"I can, can\\'t I?\"\\n   \"Professor Snape, Harry.\"\\n   \"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort\\'s going to try other ways of coming back, isn\\'t he? I mean, he hasn\\'t gone, has he?\"\\n   \"No, it isn\\'t,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He\\'s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\\'t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\\'s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could...\"\\n   \"Yeh could\\'ve died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' say the name!\"\\n   \"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\"\\n   \"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutesonly.\"\\n   And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\\'s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they\\'ll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\\'s Cross Station.\\n   It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn\\'t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\\n   \"You nearly were, I couldn\\'t have kept him off the Stone much longer-\"\\n   \"Not where I\\'m going, I promise you,\" said Harry.\\n   He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.\"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\"\\n   It was Ginny Weasley, Ron\\'s younger sister, but she wasn\\'t pointing at Ron.\\n   \"Harry Potter...\" it whispered.\\n   Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\\'t move.\\n   \"See you over the summer, then.\"\\n   \"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\"\\n   \"Ah-your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\" Dumbledore\\'s eyes twinkled. \"Useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\"\\n   \"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man\\'s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts...\\n   \"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to-Dumbledore was so worried-\"\\n   \"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort.\\n   Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\\'s face-\\n   \"Absolutely not.\"\\n   \"You must be Harry\\'s family!\" said Mrs. Weasley.\\n   \"It wasyou.\"\\n   \"I have strength enough... for this...\"\\n   Harry felt as if Devil\\'s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\\'t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell\\'s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\\n   Harry would have screamed, but he couldn\\'t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell\\'s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\\n   \"Harry!\"\\n   Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\\n   \"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \"They don\\'t know we\\'re not allowed to use magic at home. I\\'m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...\"\\n   \"...for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\\n   Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects,\"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\\'s giant chess set!\"\\n   At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\\n   \"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\\'t realize that love as powerful as your mother\\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\"\\n   Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said,\"And the Invisibility Cloak-do you know who sent it to me?\"\\n   \"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes...\\n   \"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\\'s got the Stone! Sir, quick-\"\\n   \"D\\'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your father\\'s cloak and everything?\"\\n   \"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\"\\n   Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\\n   \"And sir, there\\'s one more thing...\"\\n   \"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly.\\n   Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.\\n   \"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\\n   \"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.\\n   \"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\"\\n   After a good night\\'s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\\n   \"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we haven\\'t got all day.\" He walked away.\\n   Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\\n   \"See you, Potter!\"\\n   \"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I\\'ll need something to look forward to.\" People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:\\n   \"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\"\\n   \"Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"\\n   The room went very still. The Slytherins\\' smiles faded a little.\\n   \"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know.\"\\n   And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms-Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\\n   \"Then who does? Sir, I-\"\\n   \"He lies... He lies...\"\\n   \"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\'t realize how risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\"\\n   \"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\"\\n   \"Second-to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\\n   Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves-they were a hundred points up.\\n   \"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\"\\n   \"But that means he and his wife will die, won\\'t they?\"\\n   \"Third-to Mr. Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet \"...for pure nerve and outstanding courage'"
